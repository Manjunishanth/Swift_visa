# ✅ **DOCUMENT 1 — UNITED STATES (USA) — VISA ELIGIBILITY (CLEAN TEXT)**

**Covers:** H-1B, F-1 (Student), B-2 (Tourist) — the most common decision types for your RAG system.

---

## **H-1B (Skilled Worker) Eligibility**

**Basic Requirements:**

1. A **valid job offer** from a US employer.
2. The job must require a **specialty occupation** (bachelor’s degree or higher in a specific field).
3. The applicant must meet the **educational requirements** (degree or equivalent practical experience).
4. The employer must file a **Labor Condition Application (LCA)** with the US Department of Labor.
5. The employer must file **Form I-129** (H-1B petition).
6. Selection in the **H-1B lottery** (if subject to cap).

**Important Notes for Eligibility Queries:**

* **Income of the applicant does not affect H-1B eligibility.**
* **Age does not affect H-1B eligibility.**
* **Eligibility depends mainly on employer sponsorship + education + specialty occupation.**
* Visa approval is based on:

  * Job role → degree match
  * Employer compliance
  * Non-immigrant intent (usually)

**Eligibility Yes/No Logic:**

* If job is specialty occupation → likely eligible.
* If employer is sponsoring + filing LCA/I-129 → eligible.
* If degree does not match job → likely NOT eligible.
* If employer is fraudulent / unknown → not eligible.

---

## **F-1 (Student Visa) Eligibility**

**Required:**

1. Acceptance into a **SEVP-approved school**.
2. Issued **Form I-20**.
3. Ability to prove **financial capability** for tuition + living expenses.
4. Strong ties to home country (non-immigrant intent).
5. Valid passport.

**Important Edge Case for Your RAG:**

* If the student **has an I-20 but no funding proof**, consular officer may deny the visa.
* Eligibility **requires**:

  * Bank statements OR funding letters OR scholarship OR sponsor documents.

**Eligibility Yes/No Logic:**

* Has I-20 + funding → eligible.
* Has I-20 but **no financial proof** → NOT eligible (high risk of denial).
* Has sufficient funds but weak ties → risk of denial.

---

## **B-2 (Tourist Visa) Quick Eligibility**

1. Purpose of visit must be **temporary**.
2. Show ability to **pay expenses**.
3. Show strong home-country ties.
4. No intent to work.


USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)

OVERVIEW
This document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers.

H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria
- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer. If degree not held, evidence of equivalent education + progressive work experience may be considered. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

F-1 (Student) — Core criteria & funds
- To get an F-1 visa, applicant must be accepted by a SEVP-certified school and receive Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility). The school will require proof of sufficient funds before issuing an I-20. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- “Proof of sufficient funds” commonly means documentation that covers: first year’s tuition (or full tuition paid), living expenses for the duration of study, and return transportation. Acceptable documents: bank statements, guaranteed investment certificates (where relevant), scholarship/loan letters, sponsor affidavits, or evidence of paid tuition. There is no single universal dollar amount; expectations depend on school tuition and living cost. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Visitor (B-1/B-2) / Short stays
- The visitor visa requires showing purpose of visit (tourism, business), ties to home country, and sufficient funds for the stay. Strong evidence of intent to return (employment, property, family) helps but is assessed case-by-case. See State Dept guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

WHAT MATTERS / WHAT DOES NOT
- Matters: valid job offer + LCA + degree (H-1B); acceptance + I-20 + proof of funds (F-1); clear purpose + funds + ties to home country (B-1/B-2). Decisions influenced by documentation quality, consistency, and officer discretion. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- Typically NOT automatic disqualifiers: age alone (no public universal age limit), marital status, prior home-country income (except as proof of funds where required). These may be relevant only to the extent they affect credibility or financial sufficiency.

ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR RAG CONTENT
- Include short canonical sections: (1) H-1B — definition + evidence checklist; (2) F-1 — I-20 + funds checklist; (3) short stays — required docs list; (4) common interpretations (e.g., what proves “specialized education” or “sufficient funds”).
- Use only explicit policy text and examples; avoid asserting a specific numeric threshold for “sufficient funds” unless quoting a school or program amount.

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 8 — FREQUENT USER QUESTIONS ANSWERED
------------------------------------------------------------

Q1: **Is age 35–50 a problem for H-1B or F-1?**  
A: No. The U.S. has **no age limit rule**.

Q2: **My company is sponsoring H-1B but I have 10+ years experience and no degree — am I eligible?**  
A: Possibly. USCIS may accept 3 years experience = 1 year education equivalency if proven properly and job duties require degree-level expertise.

Q3: **I am a student with I-20 but no funding letters — can I get an F-1?**  
A: You must show **your own** or **sponsor’s** financial capacity. I-20 alone is insufficient.

Q4: **Does income in my home country matter?**  
A: Only for funding proof and credibility. Home-country income does **not** define visa eligibility.
