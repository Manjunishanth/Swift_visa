# 🇺🇸 **H-1B Salary & Specialty Occupation Rules (Clean, Accurate, No Hallucination)**

## 1. Overview

The H-1B visa requires the employer to:

* Offer a **specialty occupation** job.
* Pay at least the **prevailing wage**.
* Ensure the beneficiary meets all **qualification criteria**.

This document provides general rules used by USCIS and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).
It does **not** contain exact wage numbers (because they vary by location and change yearly).

## 2. What Counts as a Specialty Occupation

A job qualifies as a specialty occupation if **any** of the following are true:

1. **A bachelor’s degree or higher (or equivalent experience) is normally the minimum requirement** for the occupation.
2. The degree requirement is **common within the industry** for similar positions.
3. The employer normally requires a degree for that role.
4. The specific duties are so specialized and complex that a bachelor’s degree is required.

### Common Specialty Occupation Fields

These commonly qualify:

* Software Engineer, Developer, Programmer
* IT Analyst, Systems Analyst
* Data Scientist, ML/AI roles
* Electrical/Mechanical/Computer Engineer
* Accountants (with specific criteria)
* Financial analysts
* Architects
* Medical professionals
* University-level researchers
* Specialty managers (if degree-related)

### Minimum Educational Requirement

* U.S. **Bachelor’s degree** or foreign **equivalent** (evaluated).
* Or **12 years of experience** = equivalent to bachelor’s (3 years = 1 year of degree)
* Degree must be **directly related** to the job field.

## 3. SOC Codes Commonly Used

Software-related occupations typically fall under:

* **15-1252 Software Developers**
* **15-1256 Software QA/Testers**
* **15-1211 Computer Systems Analysts**
* **15-1221 Data Scientists**

These SOC codes determine prevailing wage levels.

---

## 4. Prevailing Wage Requirement (General Rules)

### The employer must pay **the higher of**:

* The **actual wage** paid to similar employees at the company, OR
* The **prevailing wage** determined by DOL for that **occupation + location + level**.

### Factors that affect prevailing wage:

1. **Job location (city/county/MSA)**

   * Large tech hubs have higher wages.
2. **Wage Level (1–4)** based on:

   * Required experience
   * Job complexity
   * Level of supervision
3. **SOC code**

### General Wage Level Meaning (Conceptual Only)

* **Level 1 (Entry)** – Basic tasks, close supervision.
* **Level 2 (Qualified)** – Moderate experience.
* **Level 3 (Experienced)** – Advanced duties.
* **Level 4 (Expert)** – Complex, leadership-level.

## 5. General Salary Expectations (Safe, Non-Numeric Range Explanation)

To avoid hallucinating any specific wage values, the following are **accurate generalizations**:

* In **high-cost cities** (e.g., San Francisco, NYC, Seattle), prevailing wages for software roles are **significantly higher** than in mid-cost areas.
* In **mid-cost cities** (Austin, Denver, Atlanta), Level-1 wages for software roles are **moderate** and can be met by many early-career salaries.
* In **low-cost areas**, Level-1 wages are **lower**, and even lower salaries may suffice.

### Key point for your chatbot:

**A salary cannot be evaluated without the location AND job level.**

## 6. How USCIS Evaluates Salary Eligibility

USCIS examines:

1. Employee’s job duties
2. SOC code assignment
3. Job location
4. Selected wage level (1–4)
5. Offered salary

If the offered salary is **lower than the prevailing wage**, the petition is usually denied or requires correction.

## 7. Required Information to Determine if Salary Is Enough

For ANY salary-eligibility question, the assistant must ask or check:

### Mandatory:

* **Job location (city/state)**
* **Job title**
* **Job duties (brief)**
* **Experience required**
* **Degree field**
* **Salary offered**

## 1. Why Salary Matters for H-1B

For H-1B visas, the employer must pay at least the **“actual wage”** or the **“prevailing wage”**, whichever is higher.

* Actual wage: what current employees in similar positions earn at the same employer.
* Prevailing wage: set by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) based on job location, SOC code, experience level (Level 1–4).

Because prevailing wages vary significantly by geography, industry, and job level, there is **no fixed universal wage threshold**. Instead we can reason using **salary bands**.

---

## 2. Salary Band Guidelines (for Software / Engineering / Common Tech Jobs)

These bands are approximate, meant to help eligibility reasoning. They are not legal thresholds.

| **Band**           | **Approx Annual Salary (USD, before tax)** | **Likely Corresponding Settings**                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Band**       | ≈ 70,000 – 90,000                          | Entry-level Software Engineer/Developer in low-to-mid cost regions; Level-1–2 wage levels.          |
| **Mid Band**       | ≈ 90,000 – 120,000                         | Junior-to-mid-level roles in mid-cost metro areas; Level-2 or low Level-3.                          |
| **Upper-Mid Band** | ≈ 120,000 – 150,000                        | Mid-to-senior roles in moderately expensive cities; Level-3 wage level.                             |
| **High Band**      | ≈ 150,000 – 200,000                        | Senior / specialized roles, in high-cost metro areas (e.g., coastal tech hubs), Level-3/4.          |
| **Top Band**       | > 200,000                                  | Senior/lead/architect/manager roles in high-cost metro regions or high-demand specialties; Level-4. |

> **Important caveats:**
>
> * These bands are **guidelines**, not legal minima.
> * Final wage eligibility depends on **job location, SOC code, required level, employer pay scales, benefits**.
> * For low-band wages, acceptance depends on **low cost-of-living area** and verifying employer’s “actual wage.”

---

## 3. When Low or Mid-Band Might Be Accepted

H-1B may still be approved at **low or mid-band** wages if:

* Job location is in a **low or mid-cost area** (lower prevailing wage).
* Role is **entry-level or junior** (Level 1 or 2).
* Employer’s “actual wage” to similar staff is in that range (not just minimum).
* The job duties match entry-level complexity (not senior/architect-level).
* Employer provides proper documentation (LCA, wage attestation).

In such cases, $75,000–85,000 in a small or mid-cost city could be valid; but in high-cost cities $100,000 might be borderline.

---

## 4. When Wage Must Be Upper-Mid or Higher

Wage should be in **Upper-Mid / High / Top Band** if:

* Job location is a **high-cost metro** (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles).
* Role demands **specialized or senior-level skills** (senior engineer, architect, management, specialized niche).
* Experience level is high (senior, 5+ years).
* Job responsibilities involve leadership, design, high responsibility, or niche domain expertise.

In such cases, $120,000–150,000 may be considered entry-level for that region/role; lower might risk denial.

## 5. Guidelines for Using Salary Bands in RAG / LLM Reasoning

When a user asks: *“My salary offer is $X, am I eligible?”* — your assistant should:

1. Ask: **“What is the job location (city/state)?”** — because prevailing wage depends strongly on location.
2. Ask: **“What is your job title & experience level (junior / mid / senior)?”** — determines the expected band.
3. Then compare X with **band ranges**, and respond with:

   * **Yes** (if X is comfortably within or above band for that location & level),
   * **Maybe / Borderline** (if X lies in lower band but location & level are low/entry),
   * **No** (if X is below band for given location & level or role is senior but wage is low).
4. Provide **explanation + caveats** (need employer’s actual wage report, SOC matching, and LCA approval).

If user does not provide location or level, the bot should return **“Need more information (location + level of role)”** rather than giving a definitive yes/no.

## 6. How to Incorporate in RAG Indexing

* Save this document as **clean text** (not chunked) in your Data folder.
* When you build embeddings, include it so RAG retrieval can fetch these guidelines.
* In prompt builder, ensure that if user asks about salary → these lines are part of retrieved context.
* This allows the LLM to make **evidence-based reasoning** rather than guesswork.

---

## 7. Example Agent-style Answer Templates

* **If user gives salary + location + role:**

  > “For a mid-cost city and junior Software Engineer role, your offered salary of US$85,000 falls in the lower end of acceptable band; assuming prevailing wage for that region is not significantly higher, this may be acceptable. You still need employer’s LCA/actual-wage attestation.”

* **If user gives salary but no location/level:**

  > “I need to know the job’s location (city/state) and your level (junior, mid, senior) to check against prevailing wage bands. Please provide those details.”

* **If user proposes senior role with low salary:**

  > “Your salary offer is below typical high-cost area senior-level ranges — this is unlikely to meet prevailing wage requirements. Consider negotiating higher pay or choosing a lower-cost region.”
