Schengen Area — Short-stay (visa) eligibility reference (tourist / business / short study / transit) — common rules across Schengen states

OVERVIEW
Schengen short-stay visa (Type C) rules are harmonized: common documentation includes valid passport, travel itinerary, sufficient funds, travel medical insurance, purpose evidence, and proof of intended return. Member states may request additional documents.

Travel medical insurance
- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

Proof of funds & purpose
- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state.

Longer permits / work & study
- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages.

HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY
- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes).

SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE
(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)

SCOPE
This file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

PRIMARY AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES USED (for RAG citations)
• European Commission — Applying for a Schengen visa (short-stay) and general visa policy. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
• EEAS / Schengen Handbook (official PDF summary of general requirements). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
• TLScontact / VFS / consulate checklists (practical document lists used by many missions). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION A — WHO NEEDS A SCHENGEN (SHORT-STAY) VISA
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A Schengen short-stay (Type C) visa permits stays up to **90 days in any 180-day period** for tourism, business, family visits and short study/training. National (long-stay) visas are separate and issued by individual Member States. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

• Whether a traveller needs a visa depends on nationality; check the official visa-exemption list on the Member State / EU pages. If the traveller is visa-exempt, they still must meet entry conditions on arrival (sufficient funds, purpose, return ticket). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION B — MANDATORY DOCUMENTS (BASELINE REQUIRED)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Every Schengen short-stay application should include (member states may request extra documents):

1. **Visa application form** — fully completed and signed. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
2. **Valid passport** — issued within the last 10 years, with at least **3 months** validity beyond planned departure from Schengen and at least two blank pages. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
3. **One recent passport photo** — ICAO standard. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
4. **Travel medical insurance** covering emergency medical treatment, hospitalisation and medical repatriation **with minimum coverage of EUR 30,000**, valid in all Schengen states for the entire duration of stay. (Proof: policy document stating coverage, duration, insured person’s name). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
5. **Proof of means of subsistence** for the entire stay (bank statements, payslips, sponsor letter + sponsor’s bank statements, traveller’s confirmed booking paid, or a formal obligation/guarantee from host/municipality). Member states may use a per-day guideline but there is **no single EU-wide fixed euro/day** for every country — consulates publish suggested minima (varies by state). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
6. **Proof of accommodation** (hotel reservation, host invitation, confirmed booking). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
7. **Round-trip flight reservation / itinerary** or proof of means to leave the Schengen area. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
8. **Purpose-specific documents** (invitation for business, conference letters, student acceptance for short courses, medical appointment letters, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

Note: many missions require the **latest 3 months** of bank statements; check the embassy/VAC checklist for the target Member State (VFS/TLSContact PDF checklists are authoritative for day-to-day filing). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION C — MEDICAL INSURANCE — EXACT REQUIREMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The insurance must cover at least **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical expenses, hospitalisation and repatriation (including in case of death). It must be valid for all Schengen countries and for the entire period of the intended stay. Provide a copy of the policy certificate showing the above. This is a strict, pan-Schengen baseline. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION D — MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE (PROOF OF FUNDS)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• There is **no single EU-wide numeric daily minimum** legally fixed for every Member State; however consulates commonly apply a per-day estimate (e.g., ~€50–€100/day) or country-specific minima and/or a fixed minimum for the full stay. Always consult the receiving Member State’s consulate checklist for the exact figure. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

• Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements (last 3 months usually), payslips, sponsorship letter + sponsor’s bank statements, official guarantee (annexation of obligation), traveller’s pre-paid accommodation & travel receipts. If sponsored by a host or company, supply formal invitation + proof of the host’s solvency. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION E — BIOMETRICS, FEES & PROCESS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• **Biometrics** (fingerprints + photo) are required for most applicants aged 12–71 at the VAC/consulate at time of application (one-time enrollment valid for 59 months across Schengen). Check VAC guidance for local procedures. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

• **Visa fee**: standard short-stay visa fee is **set at EU level** (but may be waived or reduced for some categories). Check the consulate’s page for current fee and accepted payment methods. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

• **Processing & appointments**: Many Member States use external VACs (VFS, TLScontact). Follow the exact checklist published by the embassy/VAC — missing documents are a primary cause of refusal. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION F — ENTRY & STAY RULE (LEGAL)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• A Schengen short-stay visa allows **up to 90 days in any 180-day period** across the Schengen Area. Border guards at entry may still request documents proving the purpose, sufficient funds and a return ticket; entry is not automatic. Track days carefully: the 90/180 rule is strictly enforced. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

• New biometric/entry systems (EES / ETIAS) are being rolled out in phases — these affect border checks and pre-travel authorisation in future; consult the EU/Member State news for rollout timelines. (This is operational background — check up-to-date EU announcements before advising users about future electronic authorisation requirements.) :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION G — COMMON REFUSAL REASONS (CONCISE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Insufficient or inconsistent proof of means of subsistence. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
2. No valid travel medical insurance (or coverage below €30,000). :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}  
3. Missing mandatory documents from the mission’s checklist (photos, sign, application form, passport validity). :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}  
4. Doubts about the purpose of visit or intention to return to home country. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION H — HOW TO USE THIS FILE IN RAG / DECISION LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. **Index short snippets**: create small labeled snippets for RAG (e.g., `SCHENGEN_insurance_30k`, `SCHENGEN_90_180_rule`, `SCHENGEN_proof_of_funds_examples`, `SCHENGEN_biometrics_12_71`) so retrieval returns precise factoids to the LLM. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}

2. **Decision rules (strict, no hallucination)**:
   - If policy question asks “Am I eligible?” require the user to supply: nationality, intended Schengen country, duration, purpose, proof of funds docs, insurance details, passport validity, and whether they have a prior visa refusal. If any required item missing → return **“Insufficient information”** and list exact missing documents. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}
   - If documents provided but show a gap (e.g., insurance covers only €10,000) → return **“Not eligible”** with the single corrective action (e.g., “Purchase travel insurance with minimum €30,000 cover valid in Schengen”). :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}
   - Always cite the member state checklist when giving country-specific minimums (bank/day figure) — do not assume one number for all states. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION I — QUICK CHECKLIST FOR USER INTERVIEW (to ask the user)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Nationality (passport) — do you need a visa for Schengen?  
2. Which Schengen country is your main destination? (consulate rules vary)  
3. Dates of travel — total days (to verify 90/180).  
4. Accommodation proof and travel itinerary.  
5. Bank statements (last 3 months) or sponsor proof.  
6. Travel medical insurance policy (policy name, covered amount, dates).  
7. Any prior Schengen refusals? Biometric enrolment in last 59 months?  
(If any of the above missing, ask for the specific document; give precise required format from embassy/VAC checklist.) :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION J — CITATION QUICK LINKS (for your RAG citations)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Use the following authoritative sources as top-weighted citations in responses:
• European Commission — Applying for a Schengen visa (short-stay). :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}  
• EEAS / Schengen visa requirements PDF (summary of legal rules). :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}  
• TLScontact / VFS / embassy checklists for country-specific document lists & local thresholds. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}
