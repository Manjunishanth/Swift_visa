SECTION 1 — CRITICAL SKILLS EMPLOYMENT PERMIT (CSEP)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PURPOSE
The Critical Skills Employment Permit (CSEP) is for occupations considered high-skilled and intended to attract highly skilled workers to Ireland. It encourages skilled migration with facilitated access for family members and faster routes to long-term residency. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

MANDATORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (ALL must be satisfied)
1. **Job & Employer**
   • You must have a genuine job offer from an Irish employer.  
   • The job must fall into occupations the DETE recognises for Critical Skills or otherwise meet the remuneration criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

2. **Minimum Remuneration (salary)**
   • For many Critical Skills roles, the published minimum remuneration threshold is **€38,000 per year**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   • For some roles / circumstances the alternative higher threshold **€64,000** applies (for roles not on the critical skills list or when degree is not applicable) — the DETE page states which roles and when the higher threshold applies. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

   **What counts as remuneration:** basic salary, certain allowances and regular payments as listed by DETE — consult the DETE remuneration rules on the Critical Skills page. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

3. **Qualifications**
   • Typically requires a relevant third-level degree (or equivalent professional qualifications) for roles on the Critical Skills list.  
   • The DETE guidance clarifies required qualifications by occupation; check the specific occupation guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

4. **Labour Market Needs Test**
   • The CSEP is normally **exempt** from the labour market needs test (LMNT) that applies to some General Employment Permit applications — that is one reason CSEP is preferred for high-skilled roles. Confirm on the DETE page. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

BENEFITS (clear)
• Dependants: Spouses/partners and dependants of CSEP holders may come to Ireland and are generally entitled to apply for permission to work (through the Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit or equivalent route). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

EVIDENCE CHECKLIST (minimum)
• Signed job offer / employment contract with salary and duties. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
• Proof of qualifications (degree certificates, transcripts, professional registration). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
• Employer details and company documentation if requested. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

COMMON REASONS FOR REFUSAL (explicit)
• Salary below the published threshold and not justified by an applicable exception. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

2. **Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT)**
   • Employers must typically advertise the vacancy in Ireland (EURES or other specified channels) for a set period (e.g., 28 days) before submitting the permit application, demonstrating no suitable EEA/Irish candidates were available. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

3. **Other requirements**
   • Proof of employer capacity to pay the salary and legal compliance. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

SECTION 3 — STUDENT PERMISSIONS (STUDY VISAS) & FINANCE RULES

   • Note: some practical guidance and institutions use higher living-cost approximations (e.g., €12,000 for Dublin) for budgeting, but the **official published minimum** the immigration site requires is **€10,000** immediate access. Always check the institution’s requirement shown on the offer/CAS. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 6 — HEALTH, INSURANCE & MEDICAL RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• For students: **immediate access to at least €10,000** and tuition payment capacity. :contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}

DOES NOT MATTER (by itself)
