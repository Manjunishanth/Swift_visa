At this stage of your B1/B2 tourist visa application process, you will have already completed your online visa application, submitted your biometrics, and scheduled your interview at the US embassy or consulate. Once your appointment is confirmed, it’s important to know exactly what documents to bring to your interview. Here's a detailed guide on the essential items you should prepare ahead of time.

The specific documents required may vary depending on the type of visa you are applying for, but for a B1/B2 visa interview, the following are typically expected:

Your current passport – Make sure it is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in the US.
Printed visa application fee payment receipt – You should have a copy of the payment receipt for the visa application fee.
Printed DS-160 confirmation page – A printed copy or screenshot of the confirmation page from your DS-160 form.
Photographs – Bring copies of passport-style photographs that meet the US Visa photo guidelines.
Additional guidelines
Previous Passports: While not officially required, it’s highly advisable to bring all your previous passports, including expired ones, to demonstrate proof of past travel. This can help strengthen your application.


Photograph Guidelines: Make sure the photos you bring strictly adhere to the specific format and size requirements set by the US visa application process. It’s essential to follow these instructions carefully to avoid any issues with your application.

Additional Documents: After scheduling your interview, you will receive detailed instructions from the embassy or consulate regarding the next steps. However, during your interview, the visa officer may ask you for additional documents that were not included in the original list. Don’t worry—you’ll be given an opportunity to submit these documents after the interview. The officer will provide you with a letter outlining what additional documents are needed and how to submit them.

Interview Process: It’s important to remember that the US nonimmigrant visa application process is an interview-based process, not just a documentary process. The visa officer will want to hear directly from you, the applicant, regarding your qualifications for the visa. Expect questions about your previous international travel, current travel plans, and your professional and familial ties to your home country. While you don’t need to bring excessive documentation, it’s a good idea to have any relevant documents on hand—such as proof of financial stability or business-related documents—especially if your trip is work-related.

Personal Items and Security: When attending your visa interview, it's best to bring as few personal items as possible. There are no storage facilities available at the consulate, and items such as large bags, liquids, lighters, and matches are prohibited inside the consular building. You may bring a small document pouch to carry your passport, documents, and other necessities. However, please note that electronics such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and cameras are not allowed. Additionally, photographing the embassy or consulate premises, even from the outside, can result in your interview being postponed or canceled.

By preparing these documents and following the guidelines carefully, you'll be ready for a smooth and efficient visa interview process.
Family Immigration
Family Based Immigration

A foreign citizen seeking to live permanently in the United States requires an immigrant visa (IV). To be eligible to apply for an IV, a foreign citizen must be sponsored by an immediate relative who is at least 21 years of age and is either a U.S. citizen or U.S. Lawful Permanent Resident (that is, a green-card holder).

There are two types of family-based immigrant visas:

Immediate Relative – these visas are based on a close family relationship with a U.S. citizen, such as a spouse, child or parent. The number of immigrants in these categories is not limited each fiscal year.

Family Preference – these visas are for specific, more distant, family relationships with a U.S. citizen and some specified relationships with a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). The number of immigrants in these categories is limited each fiscal year. 

Keep in mind that U.S. citizens can file an immigrant visa petition for their:

• Spouse
• Son or daughter
• Parent
• Brother or sister

U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents can only file an immigrant visa petition for their:

• Spouse
• Unmarried son or daughter
