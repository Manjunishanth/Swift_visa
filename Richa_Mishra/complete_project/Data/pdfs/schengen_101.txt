# 🇪🇺 Schengen Area — Comprehensive Visa Eligibility Reference Document

*(Short-stay Schengen C visas, National D visas, residence & work rules, travel, funds, insurance, family, study — same structure as previous country docs)*

> **Scope & accuracy:** This document describes stable, general Schengen visa rules and member-state practice that are appropriate for a visa-agent style RAG system. It **avoids** volatile numeric details (national fees, exact minimum bank balances) except where a single pan-Schengen rule exists (e.g., insurance minimum). Use country-specific documents (one per Schengen state) for precise, changing numbers.

## 1. Overview — What “Schengen” means

* The **Schengen Area** is a group of European countries that have abolished systematic internal border controls for travelers moving between them.
* A **Schengen short-stay visa (Type C)** permits stays in the Schengen Area for **up to 90 days in any 180-day period** for tourism, business, family visits, short studies, or transit.
* **National (D) visas** are issued by individual member states for longer stays (work, study, family reunification, long-term residence). Rules for D visas are decided by each member state.

---

## 2. Key Universal Rules (Apply across Schengen)

### 2.1 The 90/180 Rule (Short-stay limit)

* A non-EU/EEA national may stay in the Schengen Area for **a maximum of 90 days within any rolling 180-day period**.
* This is cumulative across all Schengen states (not per country). The 180-day window is rolling (count backwards from each day of intended stay).

### 2.2 Visa Types (Short summary)

* **Type C (Schengen short-stay):** tourism, business, family visit, short studies up to 90/180.
* **Type D (National):** long-stay (>90 days) for study, work, family reunification, residence. Issued by individual member states; may allow limited travel within Schengen for short periods.
* **Airport Transit Visa (Type A):** transit through international transit zones at airports (rare; many nationals exempt).

### 2.3 Biometric & Application Basics

* Applicants normally **must provide biometric data** (fingerprints + photo) at the visa application center (VFS/consulate), once per 59 months (approx.) unless exempt.
* Schengen visas require a **personal application** (rare exceptions for children or specific categories).

### 2.4 Travel Medical Insurance (Mandatory for short-stay)

* For Schengen Type C visas, travel medical insurance is **mandatory** and must cover **medical emergency and repatriation**.
* **Minimum cover**: **€30,000** (this is the commonly required minimum across Schengen consulates). Insurance must be valid for the entire period of intended stay and across the whole Schengen area.

### 2.5 Purpose & Supporting Documents (Short-stay)

Typical required documents (vary by consulate / nationality):

* Valid passport (valid for at least 3 months beyond intended departure from Schengen; with at least two blank pages).
* Completed and signed visa application form.
* Recent passport-style photos.
* Proof of purpose: invitation letter, hotel bookings, conference confirmation, enrolment for short course.
* Proof of financial means to cover stay.
* Proof of travel medical insurance.
* Return/onward travel tickets or reservation.
* Proof of accommodation.
* Visa fee (varies).
* For minors: birth certificate, parental consent, custody proof.

## 3. Financial Requirements / Proof of Means

* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit.
* Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship.
* Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living.
* If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds.

---

## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules

* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days).
* **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment.
* **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk.
* **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required.
* **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment.

---

## 5. Short-Term Study & Training

* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation.
* For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate.

---

## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)

* **Employment authorizations are country-specific.** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit).
* Typical pattern:

  * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state).
  * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay.
  * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities.
* **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists.

---

## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)

* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance.
* Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc.

---

## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas

* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:

  * Spouses/registered partners
  * Minor children
  * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)
* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof.
* For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits.

---

## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules

* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence.
* Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa.

---

## 10. Special Categories & Practical Notes

* **Visa-free travelers:** Many nationalities are exempt for short stays (e.g., U.S., Canada, Japan); check country-specific visa exemption lists. (Your RAG must consult per-country docs.)
* **ETIAS (coming/operational):** Citizens of visa-exempt third countries may be required to obtain an ETIAS travel authorization in future — treat as external policy (not a visa).
* **Refusal & Appeals:** Each member state has appeal or review mechanisms; timelines and procedures are country-specific.

---

## 11. Fingerprints / Biometrics / Interviews

* Biometrics are typically collected for short-stay visa applications and stored for **~59 months**.
* Interviews are rare but may be requested at the consulate.

## 12. What Information the Assistant MUST ask the User (to give definitive yes/no)

For Schengen short-stay eligibility and clear decisions, the assistant should request:

**Mandatory for clear decision:**

1. **Nationality** (passport country).
2. **Purpose of travel** (tourism, business, study <90d, family visit, transit).
3. **Dates / intended length of stay** (to check 90/180 rule).
4. **Planned Schengen countries and itinerary** (which states will be visited; main destination matters).
5. **Evidence of accommodation** (hotel booking / host address).
6. **Proof of funds or sponsor details.**
7. **Travel medical insurance details** (provider, coverage amount, validity).
8. **Return/onward travel** (ticket/reservation).
9. **Criminal history** (if any).
10. **Previous Schengen refusals or overstays.**

**For long-stay (D visa) or work/study:**

* Job offer / employer name / contract (for work).
* Acceptance letter, tuition (for study).
* Proof of relevant qualifications, language ability (if required).
* Employer work-permit details (if applicable).

---

## 13. How the Assistant Should Decide (Decision Logic, Non-Hallucinated)

* **If user is visa-exempt for short stays → return “Visa not required” (but check ETIAS/entry rules).**
* **If user lacks any mandatory document (insurance, funds, passport validity, return ticket) → “Not Eligible / Insufficient documentation.”**
* **If itinerary exceeds 90 days in 180 days or overlaps previous Schengen stays → “Not Eligible: 90/180 exceeded.”**
* **If user has missing ties or suspicious intent to overstay → mark as “High risk” and request more evidence.**
* **For national long-stay/working permission → check country-specific criteria (salary, labor test, institution acceptance).**
* **Always ask for country-specific details, then consult that country doc before stating numeric thresholds.**

---

## 14. Example Responses / Templates (Agent Style)

* **Yes (clear):** “Based on your nationality X, purpose = tourism, planned stay 7 days, valid passport and travel insurance with €30,000 cover, and proof of funds/ticket, you are eligible to apply for a Schengen short-stay visa. This is subject to consulate review.”
* **No (clear):** “Your planned stay totals 120 days in the Schengen Area within 180 days. Under the 90/180 rule you are not eligible for a Schengen short-stay visa for that itinerary.”
* **Insufficient information:** “I need the passport nationality, intended dates/duration, travel medical insurance details (provider & €30,000 cover), and proof of accommodation to decide.”

## 15. RAG / Retrieval Guidance (How to use this doc in your pipeline)

* Index this file as a **single cleaned text** source (as requested). Do **not** chunk before indexing if you want retrieval to return whole doc slices; but chunking improves targeted citations.
* For short-stay queries, retrieve sections: (a) 90/180 rule, (b) insurance, (c) required docs, (d) funds rules — these yield clear answers.
* For country-specific numeric thresholds or work permits, chain to that country’s national doc (e.g., “Germany work permit doc”, “France student visa doc”).
