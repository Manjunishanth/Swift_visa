This evaluation\nwas completed to meet the requirements of the Directive on the Evaluation Function (TBS, 2009),\nand the commitments made in CIC’s Performance Measurement and Evaluation Plan (PMEP)\nrelating to the visa imposition on Mexico. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the Visitor\nVisa Program in relation to:\n Continued Program relevance;\n Program performance; and\n Resource utilization and alternatives. The data collection for the evaluation was undertaken by CIC’s Research and Evaluation Branch\n(R&E) between April 2011 and January 2012. Visitor Visa Program background\nThroughout the report the term “Visitor Visa Program” should be understood as comprising of the\nfollowing two components:\nPolicy component\nUnder the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), every foreign national travelling to Canada\nmust obtain a temporary resident visa (TRV) before arriving, except where an exception is granted\nto citizens of selected countries under section 1901 of the IRP Regulations. Any changes in visa\nrequirements are grounded in CIC’s visitor visa framework. Ongoing monitoring, country reviews\nand consultations are carried out to inform visa policy recommendations (whether citizens from a\nparticular country require a visa or not). Implementation component\nA foreign national needs to apply for a TRV at a Canadian visa office abroad.",
  "1": "If the application is\naccepted, the TRV is issued to the applicant and they may travel to Canada, subject to the\ndetermination of entry by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) at a port of entry (POE). CIC informs potential travellers about the requirements for a visa and processes the applications\nonce received. Program objectives/outcomes\nCIC’s Visitor Visa Program seeks to achieve a balance between facilitating legitimate travel while\nprotecting the integrity of the immigration and asylum system and, in the longer term, protecting\nthe health, safety and security of Canadians. 1 Section 190 of the IRP Regulations identifies which countries do not require a visa to enter Canada. In addition,\npersons described in R39 and holders of Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) are also exempted from the TRV\nrequirement; however, those exemptions are outside the scope of this evaluation. - ii -\nMethodology\nThe key areas of study are the following:\n CIC’s country-level visa policy: focuses on the assessment of the policy framework and the\nevidence gathered to support recommendations for visitor visa requirement changes;\n Implementation of visa regulations: an examination of visa processing activities in missions\nabroad and related communications activities; and\n Mexico visa regulatory change: an examination of the design, implementation, and impact\n(performance) of the Mexico visa regulation (as required by the regulatory PMEP). The evaluation focused on the relevance and performance of the Visitor Visa Program, as well as an\nexamination of alternatives. Lines of evidence drawn upon for this evaluation included interviews,\ndocument review, literature review and analysis of administrative data. Four case studies were\nexamined, with a separate report on the Mexico regulatory change. Limitations\nThere were a number of limitations that should be considered in the context of this report. These\ninclude the fact that the perspectives of affected country representatives and international partners\nwere not included in the evaluation; and that, at the time of data collection, CIC was introducing\nseveral initiatives intended to streamline visa processing. Because they had not been in place for a\nsufficient length of time, the evaluation was not able to assess their effectiveness. However, it is\nimportant to note that these limitations have not significantly influenced the findings, conclusions\nor recommendations made in the evaluation report. Evaluation findings\nThe main findings associated with each of the evaluation questions are presented below. Relevance\nThere is a continued strong need to facilitate and control the movement of temporary residents. The visitor visa addresses this need and is used by Canada to leverage the benefits and decrease the\nrisks associated with the temporary movement of foreign nationals to and from Canada. The objectives of the visa policy framework are consistent with Government-of-Canada (GoC) and\nCIC priorities, objectives and outcomes.",
  "2": "Under the revised CIC PAA, the alignment of the Visitor\nVisa Program under Strategic Outcome 4 (Managed migration that promotes Canadian interests\nand protects the health, safety, and security of Canadians) obscures the dual nature of the\nProgram’s objectives, which are intended to balance facilitation of travel and protection of the\nintegrity of the immigration and refugee system. With its specific dual mandate, CIC is the most appropriate federal department to design and\nimplement Canada’s Visitor Visa Program even though there may be some overlap with the\nprotection and facilitation mandates of other federal departments. - iii -\nPerformance\nPolicy\nCIC’s policy framework and monitoring and country review processes are viewed as adequate. The\ncriteria and thresholds largely match international practices, although few countries use refugee\nclaim rates as an indicator to inform their visa changes. Some indicators of system integrity risks\n(such as overstays) are not currently included in the process due to lack of data collection systems. CIC engages appropriate partners and there is adequate collaboration to inform visa\nrecommendations; some OGDs feel that they are not engaged early enough in the process or that\ntheir views have not always been reflected in the final decision. Monitoring and evidence from country reviews are regularly used to support visa policy\nrecommendations and the regulatory process. However, evidence is ultimately weighed and other\ninternal and external factors play a part in the final decision to impose or lift a visa. Implementation\nCIC has been able to meet the processing demand for TRVs to date with some extension of time\nrequired to process applications. While CIC has the capacity to address seasonal fluctuations,\naddressing major regulatory changes requires additional resources. Recent streamlining initiatives\nshow some positive effects on processing activities; however, it is too early to assess their long-term\nimpact. The timeliness and breadth of CIC’s communication strategies related to immigration are\nreasonable and address a variety of potential client information needs. As materials supporting\ndecisions on changes to visa requirements are subject to Cabinet confidence, CIC faces\ncommunication constraints related to the timing of information being released to partners,\nstakeholders and to the public. Achieving outcomes\nThe visitor visa is an effective tool that helps protect the integrity of CIC’s immigration and asylum\nsystem through selecting low-risk countries for visa-free travel, and potentially acting as a deterrent\nfor non-bona fide travellers. Its role as a mechanism to prevent immigration violations is less\ncertain. The impact of the visitor visa on irregular migration is difficult to measure due to lack of\ndata on certain indicators (e.g. overstays). CIC’s Visitor Visa Program facilitates the movement of bon fide travellers, as evidenced by the fact\nthat the TRV processing requirements are similar to those in other countries; by reaching CIC\ntargets for approval rates; and by introducing other facilitative approaches and tools.",
  "3": "CIC’s visitor visa policy, supported by other tools with similar objectives, is largely perceived to\nhave successfully achieved a balance between protecting the integrity of its immigration and asylum\nsystem and the facilitation of bona-fide travel to Canada. In addition, the visa policy is flexible and\nhas the ability to allow CIC to react to contextual changes. The removal of visa exemptions affects Canada’s bilateral relations with countries impacted by the\nchange. Furthermore, the introduction or removal of visitor visa requirements can impact CIC\npartners’ operations and political mandates. - iv -\nThere is a potential negative impact on the Canadian tourism industry when a visa exemption is\nremoved, as it is expected to result in a decrease in the number of travellers from the affected\ncountry. Conversely, when a visa exemption is granted, it should have a positive impact on tourism. The available evidence supports these assumptions, although data on the magnitude of the impact\nare mixed. Costs and alternatives\nAlthough the evaluation framework did not include a detailed analysis of program costs, available\ndata suggests that there are several financial resource implications associated with TRVs. Furthermore, according to internal financial data, the costs of processing a visa are higher than the\nrevenue generated from TRV fees. There are several potential alternatives to CIC’s approach to TRVs. While they are unlikely to better\nmeet CIC’s facilitation and integrity objectives at the present time, some could be effectively used\nto supplement existing frameworks, tools and indicator, thereby creating a more encompassing\nsystem. Relevance/alternatives\nThe visitor visa is a relevant tool as it addresses the need to manage the movement of temporary\nresidents. It remains widely used by peer countries. In the majority of cases, Canada’s visa\nexemption list aligns with its peers. This creates an environment where Canada facilitates travel,\nwhile preventing the entry of travellers that could pose risks to the integrity of the immigration and\nasylum system and the safety and health of Canadians. While potential alternatives to Canada’s visitor visa exist, such as an electronic travel authorization\n(eTA) system, the visitor visa will remain the most effective tool to manage migration until other\ntools are further investigated / implemented and their effectiveness is assessed. Recommendation #1: Canada should continue using the visitor visa as a tool to manage migration,\nwhile at the same time investigate the feasibility of introducing supplementary tools to better meet its objectives\n(protection and facilitation). In doing so, CIC should take into account the benefits, risks and resource needs\nassociated with implementing each option. Performance\nPolicy\nMonitoring and evidence from country reviews are regularly used to support visa policy\nrecommendations and the regulatory process. However, the visitor visa program, as currently\ndesigned, focuses on CIC’s own objectives and is not taking a whole-of-government approach. While the policy process seeks input of relevant other government departments, there is a need to\nimprove their involvement and participation in analysis and decision-making processes.",
  "4": "Recommendation #2: CIC should assess, with its federal government partners, the strengths and\nweaknesses of the current partner engagement strategy in visa policy development, to address their needs and\nconcerns and gauge the feasibility of broadening the considerations during the visa review process, towards an\nincreased whole-of-government approach. - v -\nProcessing\nThe evaluation presented recent CIC efforts to introduce or expand various facilitative\nmechanisms; such as VACs, multiple entry visas, long-term visas, business express program, etc. to\nensure streamlining of processing of applications. Those initiatives have the purpose of creating\nstreamlined processes to make it easier for clients to visit Canada and reduce resource utilization at\nCIC. As those are fairly new initiatives, this evaluation did not assess effectiveness of those\nmechanisms at this point. In addition, the evaluation reviewed the role of the VAC in supporting processing in Mexico,\nidentified some benefits but also the importance of undertaking performance and contract reviews\nto ensure compliance. With expansion of the VAC network in the world, CIC is relying increasingly\non a variety of third-party organizations to support the TRV process. The expansion of VAC to a\nglobal network is a new initiative and creates new opportunities and possible challenges. Recommendation #3: CIC should develop strategy and assessment tools to measure the impact of the\nvarious facilitative mechanisms, in terms of their objectives and effectiveness in managing processing demands. This should also include an assessment of the VAC network and its effectiveness in assisting the modernizing\nof CIC operations. Integrity of the immigration and asylum systems\nThe visitor visa is an effective tool that helps protect the integrity of CIC’s immigration and asylum\nsystem by reducing irregular migration (primarily unfounded refugee claims), and potentially\nplaying a deterrence role. Measuring the overall impact of the visa on irregular migration is\nchallenging due to lack of data on certain indicators (i.e. overstays, illegally working in Canada, etc.). Recommendation #4: CIC should explore other, more effective methods of collecting data on irregular\nmigration, such as overstays, to better inform policy-makers about the success of the program in achieving its\nimmigration and asylum system integrity objectives. - vi -\nEvaluation of CIC’s Visitor Visa Program - Management response\nCompletion\nRecommendations Response Action Accountability\ndate\n1.

Introduction\nThis report presents the findings of the evaluation of the CIC Visitor Visa Program. This\nevaluation was completed to meet the requirements of the Directive on the Evaluation Function\n(TBS, 2009), and the commitments made in CIC’s Performance Measurement and Evaluation Plan\n(PMEP) relating to the visa imposition on Mexico. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the\nVisitor Visa Program in relation to:\n Continued Program relevance;\n Program performance; and\n Resource utilization and alternatives. It is important to note that a “Visitor Visa Program” does not exist in the Department as a\ntraditional program; rather, CIC’s Admissibility Branch is responsible for the development and\nmaintenance of Canada’s visa policy that governs whether or not citizens from a particular country\nrequire a visa to enter Canada. This policy is operationalized through CIC’s International Region by\nprocessing temporary resident visas abroad. These two components fall under the Program\nActivity Architecture (PAA) element 4.2.2 – Visitors, which is part of Strategic Outcome 4 –\nManaged migration that promotes Canadian interests and protects the health, safety, and security of Canadians. Therefore, for the purposes of simplification, throughout the report the term “Visitor Visa\nProgram” should be understood as referring to both of these components collectively. 1.1.",
  "7": "Organization of the report\nThe report consists of four sections: Chapter 1 provides the background of the program; Chapter 2\ndescribes the methodology used to conduct the evaluation; Chapter 3 presents the evaluation\nfindings and evidence; and Chapter 4 contains recommendations based on the findings and\nconclusions of the evaluation. 1.2. Program background\nUnder the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), every foreign national travelling to Canada\nmust have a temporary resident visa (TRV) before arriving, except where an exception is granted to\ncitizens of selected countries under section 1902 of the IRP Regulations. A foreign national who wishes to come to Canada from a visa-required country needs to apply for\na TRV at a Canadian visa office abroad (CVOA). If the application is accepted, the TRV is issued to\nthe applicant in their travel document and they may travel to Canada, subject to the determination\nof entry by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) personnel at a port of entry (POE). There are many potential benefits that result from the temporary migration of foreign visitors to\nCanada, such as the development and growth of the tourism industry, increases to trade and\ninternational understanding, and cultural exchanges. While Canada may benefit from international\ntravel, it may also be exposed to risks ranging from the potential spread of infectious diseases,\nadmission of persons who pose a safety or security risk, transnational crime, and human trafficking. Canada assesses countries against several criteria and risk factors when deciding whether to lift or\nimpose a visa requirement. From 2002 to 2012, visa exemptions were extended to nine countries,\n2 Section 190 of the IRP Regulations identifies which countries do not require a visa to enter Canada. In addition,\npersons described in R39 and holders of Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) are also exempted from the TRV\nrequirement; however, those exemptions are outside the scope of this evaluation. 1\nwhile visa requirements were introduced for five countries. Citizens of 55 countries and territories\nare currently visa-exempt for travel to Canada, while citizens of 142 countries and territories are\nvisa-required. For the countries for which a visitor visa is required, the processing of visitor visa applications from\npersons intending to travel to Canada is carried out by CIC in the missions abroad, in cooperation\nwith its federal partners. In total, there are 86 offices with CIC presence abroad in 72 countries;\ncurrently 64 are processing visitor visa applications. In 2010, CIC processed applications from over\none million persons seeking temporary resident visas as tourists and business visitors to Canada,\nand issued visitor visas, permits and extensions to around 865,000 persons. Visitor Visa Program\nThe following sections describe the key activities and outcomes of the Visitor Visa Program (see\nTechnical appendices) stemming from the two components of the Program: policy and\nimplementation.",
  "8": "Visa Policy: The following activities take place to inform recommendations on the exemption or\nre-imposition of a visa requirement:\n Visa policy framework development: In 2005, CIC established a set of formal criteria to be\nused to guide the development of visa policy recommendations; including indicators and\nthreshold values.  Country monitoring: This refers to the activities that gather evidence on country conditions,\nto support ongoing risk analysis, as well as the development of recommendations.  Consultations/coordination: To support the development of visa requirement\nrecommendations, CIC conducts consultations with other federal government partners. The above activities are designed to enable CIC to make recommendations that are evidence-based,\nrisk-based, and consultative (immediate outcome). Implementation: The implementation component of the Visitor Visa Program has the following\nkey activities:\n Processing: CIC officers assess applications, in cooperation with federal security and health\npartners. If the application is accepted, the TRV is issued to the applicant as a secure\ncounterfoil document affixed to their passport and they may travel to Canada. It is important to\nnote that a TRV does not guarantee entry to Canada; entry is still subject to determination by\nthe Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) personnel at the POE.  Communications: Regular communications are required in order to provide potential\napplicants with timely information on application requirements, processing, timelines, etc. In\nthe case of changes to the visitor visa policy, these decisions must be communicated to the\naffected stakeholders. These activities should result in informing relevant stakeholders about visa requirements and\nmeeting the demand for visitor visas (immediate outcome). At the intermediate level, both components of the CIC’s Visitor Visa Program seek to balance the\nobjectives of facilitating legitimate travel while protecting the integrity of the immigration and\nasylum system and, in the longer term, protection of Canada’s interests and the health, safety and\nsecurity of Canadians. 2\n2. Methodology\n2.1. Evaluation scope\nData collection for this evaluation took place between April and December 2011, with the\nevaluation covering April 2005 to March 2011. Some recent events are reflected in the report as\ncontext for the purpose of capturing further developments in the visitor visa program. The key\nareas of study are the following:\n CIC’s country-level visa policy: focuses on the assessment of the policy framework and the\nevidence gathered to support recommendations for visitor visa requirement changes;\n Implementation of visa regulations: an examination of visa processing activities in missions\nabroad and related communications activities; and\n Mexico visa regulatory change: an examination of the design, implementation, and impact\n(performance) of the Mexico visa regulation. There are several issues directly or tangentially related to the visitor visa continuum that are beyond\nthe scope of this report and will be assessed within other evaluations. These issues include: health\nand security screening and the in-Canada asylum system. While this evaluation does not\ncomprehensively examine these issues, they are described in the context of the visitor visa\ncontinuum.",
  "9": "Prior to the completion of this report, in November 2011, the Office of the Auditor General\n(OAG) released its Fall report, one chapter of which pertained to the issuance of visas. Although\nthere is some overlap between that report and this evaluation, the focus of the OAG audit was “to\ndetermine whether CIC and CBSA have managed the risks associated with determining\nadmissibility under the Act’s provisions related to health, safety, and security before issuing visas to\nforeign nationals,”3 rather than the broader visa policy framework development and\nimplementation examined in the current study.4\n2.2. Approach\nThe evaluation focused on the relevance and performance of the Visitor Visa Program, as well as an\nexamination of alternatives (see Appendix A: Evaluation matrix). The evaluation did not use an experimental design as it was not possible to create a control group. Certain elements of a quasi-experimental design were applied when comparing the pre- and post-\nsituations of the case study countries, and when comparing the visa-required and non-required\ncountries. 2.3. Lines of evidence\nSeveral lines of evidence were used for this evaluation, including both quantitative and qualitative\nsources. Each evaluation question was assessed using at least two lines of evidence. Using multiple\n3 Office of the Auditor General, 2011. “Fall Report of the Auditor General, Chapter 2: Issuing Visas”. www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_201111_02_e_35934.html\n4 Note: Both CIC and CBSA have accepted the recommendations made by the Auditor General, and have provided\naction plans for addressing the issues raised in that report. 3\nlines of evidence allowed questions to be examined from several perspectives, providing greater\nreliability and validity of the findings when these lines of evidence converged. 2.3.1. Document review\nA document review was conducted to provide descriptive information on the two components of\nthe visitor visa program, as well as information to address evaluation questions relating to program\nrelevance and performance. Documents reviewed included legislation, policy documents, process\nand procedure documents, operational manuals and bulletins. 2.3.2. Key informant interviews\nInterviews with key informants were held to address all evaluation questions. Only one\ncomprehensive interview guide was developed, as many interviewees had been involved in different\ncomponents of the program, and could thus potentially respond to the full set of questions. The\nevaluation aimed to obtain perspectives from both sides of the spectrum – the facilitative and the\nprotective one. A total of 31 interviews were completed, as follows:\n CIC managers and officers at NHQ (n=15)\n CIC managers and officers at selected missions (n=7)\n Representatives from other federal departments, focused on protective aspects, such as\npartners participating in the policy working group and involved in screening activities (CBSA,\nRCMP) (n=4)\n Representatives of partners and stakeholders with facilitative mandates, such as DFAIT,\nIndustry Canada, and the Canadian Tourism Commission (n=5)\nInterviews lasted between 45 minutes and two hours. Not all informants responded to all\nquestions; this was taken into account when analysing the data (Technical appendix).",

Case studies\nCase studies provided a means of examining key visa requirement changes, as well as the\nimplementation of these decisions. Two of the case study countries had a visa exemption removed\nand two had visa exemption granted in the period under review. The case study countries were as\nfollows:\n Czech Republic (2009 visa exemption removed)\n4\n Mexico (2009 visa exemption removed)\n Poland (2008 visa exemption granted)\n Taiwan (2010 visa exemption granted)\nThese case studies included a review of planning documents and interviews with key informants\nwho had first-hand involvement with the development and/or implementation of these policy and\nimplementation activities, such as processing and communications, especially as related to the\nMexico case study. An assessment of administrative and operational data pertaining to the missions\nserving these countries was also conducted. For the Mexico case study, a field visit was conducted\nin September 2011 that included a site examination, as well as interviews with personnel located in\nthe Mexico City mission and Visa Application Centre (VAC). While information on all case study\ncountries is provided throughout the report, a separate report was developed for the Mexico case\nstudy as required by the PMEP. It is included in the Technical appendix. 2.3.4. Administrative data analysis\nCIC has several information systems (CAIPS, GCMS and FOSS) that provide administrative data\non the monitoring criteria and processing of visitor visa applications. The analysis of these data was\na key source of information for program performance. Data was also provided by program delivery\npartners (e.g., the number and type of inadmissibility reports issued by CBSA) and other\ngovernment departments and agencies (e.g., StatsCan data on the number and origin of travellers to\nCanada). 2.3.5. Literature review\nContext review\nA review of literature discussing temporary resident migration management was conducted by the\nevaluation team to obtain perspectives and information regarding trends in the temporary\nmovement to support the assessment of relevance. The literature reviewed focused on the need for\nborder and entry control and for the facilitation of travel.",
  "11": "Alternatives study\nAs a means of obtaining an additional perspective on the relative merits of Canada’s approach to\nthe management of temporary resident admissions, an external academic expert was commissioned\nto undertake a comparative study of the frameworks employed by Australia, the U.S., and the\nEuropean Union. Key issues examined through the study related to the rationale for these different\napproaches, the contexts under which they were introduced, the strengths and weaknesses of these\napproaches with respect to balancing travel facilitation and security safeguarding, the impacts, and\nlessons learned to date. The report is provided in the Technical appendix, and includes a list of the\nliterature and documents reviewed. 5\n2.4. Limitations and considerations\nThere were a number of limitations that should be considered in the context of this report. However, it is important to note that these limitations have not significantly influenced the\nfindings, conclusions or recommendations in the evaluation.  Perspectives of affected country representatives: Given the sensitive nature of the visa\nrequirement decisions, representatives of affected countries were not approached for\ncomments. Their input could have been affected by the nature of the decision and it was\ndeemed not appropriate for the analysis. To mitigate this, attention was paid to information\nabout country reactions to visa requirement decisions coming from other sources (e.g., media,\nCanadian representatives abroad, and policymakers).  Perspectives of international partners: Given the difficulty in reaching international\npartners and the limited value of this perspective in informing the evaluation, interviews with\ninternational partners were omitted, in favour of the analysis of alternatives used in other\ncountries. This allowed for a more in-depth and objective assessment of the effectiveness of\nvarious alternatives.  Process streamlining initiative results: At the time of data collection, CIC was introducing\nseveral initiatives intended to streamline visa processing (e.g. ; Visa Application Centres,\nmultiple-entry visas, long-duration visas). Because they had not been in place for a sufficient\nlength of time, the evaluation was not able to assess their effectiveness. 6\n3. Findings\n3.1. Relevance\nUsing information from the document review, interviews, administrative data analysis, literature\nreview, and case studies, this section presents the key findings regarding the relevance of the Visitor\nVisa Program. 3.1.1. Continued need\nThe objective of CIC’s Visitor Visa Program is to facilitate the movement of bona fide travellers\nwhile protecting the integrity of Canada’s immigration and asylum system, and the health, safety,\nand security of Canadians. The need to control and facilitate the temporary resident movement,\nand the need for the visitor visa as an instrument are reviewed in this section. Finding: There is a continued strong need to facilitate and control the movement of temporary\nresidents. The visitor visa addresses this need and is used by Canada to leverage the benefits and\ndecrease the risks associated with the temporary movement of foreign nationals to and from\nCanada.",
  "12": "As noted in the literature, “global international migration has undergone a transformation in the\nlast decade and one of the main elements in this has been the substantial increase in non-permanent\n… migration between nations.”5 In Canada, the number of visa applications (persons) has\nincreased since 2007 (from 1,231,081 TRV applicants in 2007 to 1,367,831 in 2011, representing an\n11% increase). Furthermore, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization,\ninternational tourist arrivals globally grew by over 4% in 2011 to 980 million, with growth expected\nto continue, on track to reach one billion tourists in 2012.6 This trend is linked to the development\nof means of transportation, communication technologies, increased knowledge of other countries,\nand the growth of social networks that extend beyond one’s own country/community. The document and literature review and almost all interview respondents indicated a strong need\nfor Canada to continue to control the movement of temporary residents, including visitors, for\nseveral reasons: need for managed access to Canada; protection of the health, safety and security of\nCanadians; program integrity; and the facilitation of travel to leverage benefits. Manage access/control movement\nHistorically, the ability to precisely define (and control) borders is one of the hallmarks of the\nmodern state.7 Growing internationalization makes it harder to retain control over one’s borders\nand the policies enacted therein.8 In this vein, most interviewees confirmed that there is a need to\nmanage access to Canada in order to ensure an orderly flow and that those who enter Canada meet\nthe requirements of entry. Globally, visitor visas are an internationally accepted and prevalent practice. Each country\ndetermines who is allowed to enter and for how long. The EU’s Schengen Zone is the most\nnoteworthy visa-free zone; however, even in the EU, while there is borderless travel within the\n5 Circular migration, keeping development rolling. Graeme Hugo, University of Adelaide, IOM. 2008. 6 media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2012-01-16/international-tourism-reach-one-billion-2012\n7 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2010. “Sovereignty.” plato.stanford.edu/entries/sovereignty/\n8 Hall, Stuart et al., eds, 1996. Modernity: An Introduction to Modern Societies. Maidenhead: Open University Press\n7\nzone, there are still visa requirements for countries to enter the external border of the EU. The\nprevalence of visa requirements around the globe suggests that Canada’s visitor visa tool, with its\nbroad requirements and country exemptions, is aligned with those employed by other countries to\nachieve similar objectives. Some interviewees commented that the visa has been one of the few tools a country has to control\naccess. The majority of interviewees described the need for the visitor visa mechanism as relating to\nthe fact that it is more difficult to remove that individual if they do not abide by the terms and\nconditions of entry than to pre-emptively deny them entry. Even the interviewees who stressed the\nneed to facilitate travel for economic purposes and other benefits affirmed the need for a\nmechanism, such as a visitor visa, to control against the risks associated with over-generous\nfacilitation.",
  "13": "Protection of the health, safety and security of Canadians\nThe literature, documents and key informants frame the need to control the movement of\ntemporary residents as a mechanism to protect the health, safety and security of Canada. Events\nsuch as Sept 11th, 2001, and major health disasters such as the SARS and the H1N1 pandemic,\nhave contributed to migration policies becoming more concerned with heightened security, and\nglobal health issues. In particular, this need for control is similar to the rationale for controlling the\nadmission of those who seek to become permanent residents of Canada. In both cases, the benefits\nof allowing people into the country (e.g., economic, intellectual, and cultural exchanges) need to be\nweighed against the risks presented by those seeking to enter the country (e.g., threats to the health,\nsafety, and security of Canadian residents). The temporary resident visa aims to serve as an\nadmissibility and screening tool that helps to ensure the balance of these factors.9 Furthermore, the\nmajority of interviewees noted that threats from drug and human trafficking, terrorism, as well as\npotential criminal activities, result in a need to control who enters the country. Program integrity\nInternal CIC documents and many key informants clearly articulated a need to control temporary\nmigration due to potential risks to program integrity, the most commonly cited threat being\nirregular migration. One of the key forms of irregular migration associated with temporary\nresidents are overstays: the risk that temporary residents will not leave the country by the date\nspecified by the border officer at the Port of Entry (POE) is a key concern. Additionally,\nunfounded refugee claims made by temporary residents are viewed as a significant problem in\nCanada, as they require resources that could be used for the processing of legitimate asylum\nclaimants. The admission of visitors without appropriate documentation also constitutes a risk in\nterms of potential identity fraud. Similarly, people with prior criminal records and/or ties to\ncriminal organizations pose a risk of engaging in similar activities in Canada; controlling the\nmovement of temporary residents helps prevent inadmissible people from entering Canada, thus\ncontributing to the integrity of Canada’s immigration system. In order to assess the bona fides of\nthose seeking to enter Canada, officers in missions and Ports of Entry assess the backgrounds and\ntravel documents of those people passing through inspection points. 9 Citizenship and Immigration Canada, n.d. “Overview of Canada’s Visa Policy and Visa Review Process.” Internal\ndocument. 8\nLeveraging benefits\nIn literature, benefits of facilitated travel were identified as economic (e.g., growth in tourism and\ntrade), social (e.g., cultural exchanges and strengthened family linkages), political (e.g.,\nimprovements to diplomatic relations), or even as related to international security (e.g., increased\ncollaboration in terms of information sharing and ongoing cooperation). Some interview respondents, particularly those who worked in fields related to international\nrelations, trade, or tourism, stressed the need to facilitate the movement of temporary residents in\norder to access the benefits associated with international travel.",
  "14": "These interviewees also saw the\nneed to facilitate travel as being linked with improving international relations. 3.1.2. Alignment with GoC and CIC objectives and outcomes\nTo assess alignment of the Visitor Visa Program with GoC and CIC objectives, its objectives were\ncompared with GoC Results for Canadians and the CIC’s strategic outcomes. Finding: The objectives of the visa policy framework are consistent with GoC and CIC priorities,\nobjectives and outcomes. Under the revised CIC PAA, the alignment of the Visitor Visa Program\nunder Strategic Outcome 4 (Promotion of Canadian interests and protecting the health, safety and\nsecurity of Canada) obscures the dual nature of the Program’s objectives, which are intended to\nbalance facilitation of travel and protection of the integrity of the immigration and refugee\nsystem. Alignment with GoC objectives and outcomes\nOverall, the visa policy program is largely aligned with all four of the Government of Canada’s\noutcome areas as defined in the Results for Canadians framework: economic affairs, social affairs,\ninternational affairs and government affairs. A review of the Program objectives– facilitation and\nprotection - suggest that it supports the GoC objectives of economic and international affairs on\nthe facilitation side, and the social and government affairs on the protection side (i.e. re-imposing\nvisa requirements, security, health and criminality screening). Alignment with CIC outcomes\nThe Visitor Visa Program is currently one of the elements under the departmental Strategic\nOutcome 4 of Managed migration that promotes Canadian interests and protects the health, safety and security of\nCanadians. In the revised CIC PAA (Technical appendix), which took effect in the beginning of the 2010-11\nfiscal year, the Visitor Visa Program is linked directly to Strategic Outcome 4 – Promotion of Canadian\nInterests and protecting the health, safety and security of Canada. This Strategic Outcome is not\nwell-described to enable assessment of the alignment between the Visitor Visa Program objectives\nand this Strategic Outcome. In addition, the result 4.2 – Migration Control and Security Management, to\nwhich Visitor Visa Program contributes, states in its description that the TRV requirement is seen\nas Canada’s primary means of controlling migration and allows for the screening of individuals for health, safety and\nsecurity risks before they begin travel to Canada. While the aim of the Visitor Visa Program is to balance the\ntwin objectives of facilitation and integrity, the focus of result 4.2 is mainly on protection, with\nlimited mention of facilitation. 9\nThe alignment of the visitor visa objectives with CIC’s program activity areas was more evident\nunder the previous PAA structure (2005-2010), where it was located during most of the period\nunder review, together with other temporary resident programs, under the previous Strategic\nOutcome 1 – Migration that significantly benefits Canada’s economic, social and cultural development, while\nprotecting the health, safety and security of Canadians. The dual objectives of the Visitor Visa Program were\ndirectly aligned with the previous Strategic Outcome statement.",
  "15": "Currently that link may not be as\nclear, although the Program does include facilitative elements, such as granting a visa exemption on\na country, as well as the introduction of processing streamlining mechanisms. Lastly, the majority of interviewees held that Canada’s visitor visa policy objectives are broadly\naligned with the Government of Canada and CIC’s objectives with respect to the facilitation of\ntravel and ensuring protection. Some interviewees stated that this alignment is a matter of degree:\nthat the objectives are aligned, but the magnitude of some of the potential consequences, such as\ndecreased tourism to as a result of a visa imposition, is unintended. A few interviewees held that\nCanada is moving towards being able to achieve both objectives. Canada does not want to hinder\ninvestment or other opportunities, but this could occur following changes to visitor visa\nrequirements. 3.1.3. Alignment with roles and responsibilities\nThis section reviewed the federal role vis-à-vis immigration as well as roles of federal departments\ninvolved in the visitor visa policymaking. Finding: With its specific dual mandate, CIC is the most appropriate federal department to design\nand implement Canada’s Visitor Visa Program even though there may be some overlap with the\nprotection and facilitation mandates of other federal departments. Federal and provincial roles and responsibilities\nWhile immigration is a shared responsibility, defining immigration policies and processing\ntemporary resident applications falls within the federal sphere. The federal government has the\nauthority to make decisions regarding the admissibility of those who intend to enter Canada. Immigration agreements with provinces place some responsibilities on the federal government to\nconsult with provincial governments when visitor visa applicants are coming to Canada for the\npurpose of receiving medical care, and when the applicant could potentially be medically\ninadmissible to Canada. Additionally, some federal-provincial collaboration occurs with regard to\nthe promotion of provinces to potential visitors. In terms of policy-making and regulatory changes,\nprovincial considerations are taken into account when assessing the impact of potential refugee\nclaims on social and health systems. As with most immigration programs, provinces may be\ninvolved in applicant selection, however, admissibility screening remains a federal responsibility. Federal departments’ roles and responsibilities\nAs defined in IRPA, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has the ultimate authority for the\nestablishment of visa requirements. However, other departments and agencies have mandates that\nalign to varying degrees with the Visitor Visa Program’s objectives of facilitating and securing\nforeign travellers’ access to Canada. A review of the mandates of CIC, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the Department of\nForeign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), and the opinions of most interviewees suggest\n10\nthat the objectives of the Visitor Visa Program are most explicitly aligned with the mandate of CIC. These objectives (facilitation and protection) are not as directly aligned with the mandates of\nDFAIT or CBSA; DFAIT emphasis is on facilitation, while the CBSA focuses on the protection of\nCanada and Canadians.",
  "16": "The majority of interviewees commented that the respective roles of these departments in support\nof the Visitor Visa Program were generally clear and appropriate. They are involved in discussions\nand consultations concerning country monitoring and country reviews, and are able to present their\nparticular perspectives and interests in the visa decision process. However, some interviewees\nnoted that the division of roles between CBSA and CIC may lack clarity, due to the fact that the two\norganizations both administer the same Act. They perceive CIC as the facilitators and CBSA as the\nenforcers, despite the fact that CIC also performs protection/security functions, and CBSA also\nperforms facilitation functions. In terms of the implementation of the Visitor Visa Program, CIC’s role is aligned with its\nresponsibilities, as outlined in IRPA. Visa officers screen foreign nationals and issue Temporary\nResident Visas in compliance with IRPA and IRPR requirements. Other government departments\nparticipate in policy development and processing of TRV applications and include: DFAIT, CBSA,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and, if needed, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service\n(CSIS). In addition, DFAIT also plays a role vis-à-vis the implementation of the visa program as it\nprovides information, services, and infrastructure to CIC’s immigration services overseas, and is\ninvolved in communications with country representatives and trade partners as part of its role in\nmanaging foreign relations.10 While CIC is the main author of visitor visa decision communication\nmessages, DFAIT representatives are frequently the official spokespeople presenting these\ndecisions. 3.2. Performance – Policy\nCIC’s Admissibility Branch undertakes several activities when developing recommendations for\nthe Minister regarding whether or not Canada should grant or remove a visa requirement (a visa\npolicy decision). These activities include: the development and maintenance of a visa policy\nframework, ongoing monitoring for all countries and in-depth reviews for selected countries. This\nalso involves bringing together multiple partners and stakeholders from within the Canadian\nfederal government, and may involve seeking information from the governments of affected\ncountries or other stakeholder groups. Through these processes, evidence is gathered in order to\nassess whether a change in the visitor visa requirement is required, and to support any subsequent\ndecision. It should be noted that the final authority regarding changes to visa regulations rests with\nthe Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and\nMulticulturalism. This section presents findings regarding the performance of the visitor visa policy component, and\ndiscusses the activities and achievements of the related immediate outcome. 3.2.1. Visa policy framework\nCIC established its visa policy framework in 2005, which includes a set of main categories, criteria\nand thresholds. The evaluation assessed the criteria, indicators, and thresholds that were developed\nto support the country monitoring and review processes and development of recommendations. 10 Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2010. “Performance Measurement and Evaluation Plan: Regulations\nAmending the Immigration And Refugee Protection Regulations (Mexico).” Internal document. 11\nFinding: CIC’s policy framework and monitoring and country review processes are viewed as\nadequate.",
  "17": "The criteria and thresholds largely match international practices, although only select\ncountries use refugee claim rates as an indicator to inform their visa changes. Some indicators of\nsystem integrity risks (such as overstays) are not currently included in the process due to lack of\ndata collection systems. Appropriateness of visa policy framework design\nBefore 2005, CIC did not have a formalized visa policy framework. CIC established its country\nmonitoring criteria (visa policy framework), indicators and thresholds, to provide an objective\nframework for the assessment of country risks, and to support the development of evidence-based\nrecommendations. The framework includes more than forty criteria grouped into seven categories: socio-economic\nindicators, immigration issues, travel documents, border management, safety and security issues,\nhuman rights, and bilateral cooperation on removals (Technical appendix). There are nine\nindicators known as threshold criteria, which are monitored on an ongoing basis. Three criteria are\nquantitative in nature, and are instrumental in determining whether further investigation of the\ncountry through the country review process is warranted. The quantitative threshold criteria consist\nof the following: TRV refusal rates; immigration violations;11 and the number of refugee claims\nmade in Canada by foreign nationals. Other indicators with thresholds that are not quantitative but\nhave defined parameters, include: passport security; passport production; the treatment of lost and\nstolen passports; national security; bilateral cooperation on removals; and bilateral cooperation on\nimmigration integrity and law enforcement. Information for these indicators is drawn from a number of sources, including statistical reports,\nopen source reports and media articles, and information provided by other departments and\nagencies, such as CBSA, DFAIT and the IRB. Once there is an indication that the country meets or\nexceeds the stated thresholds, it triggers internal discussion in the Admissibility Branch and at the\nsenior management level; this may result in a full assessment through the country review process. This is an in-depth investigation of areas of concern or opportunities for a potential change in the\ncountry’s visa requirement. The criteria and thresholds contribute to the assessment of risks\nassociated with specific countries, and thus guide the decision to recommend granting or removing\na visa exemption for nationals of those countries. The media review indicated that at the time of introduction of the framework, the affected country\nrepresentatives appreciated the existence of the framework as it provided them with a set of\nobjective criteria and an understanding of where they need to make changes to increase the\npotential of visa removal for their countries. Most of the interviewees agreed that the indicators and\nthresholds are appropriate and very comprehensive. The framework provides a good tool to assess\nvarious countries using the same criteria and thus allows for a consistent, comparable, and holistic\nassessment. While some interviewees commented that the framework is too extensive, others mentioned a\nnumber of additional indicators that could be useful in the monitoring framework. For example:\n11 This threshold refers to all documented cases of non-compliance with requirements of the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act.",
  "18": "This incorporates all reports of non-compliance prepared under Section 44 of the IRPA. It also takes\ninto account all instances in which foreign nationals are determined to be inadmissible to Canada at a port of entry and\nallowed to voluntarily return to their country of origin. 12\nmeasuring overstays, working illegally, or rates of permanent resident applications filed within\nCanada after being admitted as visitor, could be effective indicators of irregular migration. Currently, these indicators are not collected due to the absence of control systems for tracking\npurposes. Some interviewees noted that CIC’s current targets and thresholds do not measure all push and pull\nfactors that affect the temporary movement to Canada, such as the features of the Canadian asylum\nsystem which were frequently mentioned as the most generous in the world. In addition, the visa\npolicy framework does not include a detailed assessment of internal Canadian concerns, such as the\npotential effect of a visa requirement change on the volume of trade, or implications for the\nCanadian economy, cultural, or social context. Those are assessed, to some degree, as part of the\nconsultative decision-making process in cooperation with Canadian partners. Consistency with international practices\nA comparison of the Five Country Conference members12 and the EU suggests that Canada’s\nframework is very comprehensive, and includes almost all criteria used by other countries. Some\ndifferences include: Canada and Australia are the only countries reviewed that use asylum claims\ndirectly as an indicator. While some other countries assess economic, cultural, and\nsocial/reputational impacts related to potential visa imposition in their review process, Canada\ntakes these impacts into account through consultation with partners and the regulatory process. 3.2.2. Country monitoring\nThe established framework is used to conduct ongoing country monitoring and guides the country\nreview process for selected cases. To assess appropriateness of country monitoring, the evaluation\nlooked at ongoing monitoring and country review process. Appropriateness of ongoing monitoring\nThe ongoing monitoring conducted by the Admissibility Branch examines the key indicators\nthrough which country risks are measured. This monitoring is facilitated by a variety of\nadministrative data that are collected from CIC databases and other government department\n(OGD) systems. Monitoring data are collected and updated regularly, which allows for the rapid\nassessment of emergent issues for specific countries with respect to the quantitative thresholds. CIC’s Admissibility Branch maintains a database that tracks the status of quantitative threshold\nindicator information. Other monitoring activities include the regular review of domestic and\ninternational media articles, and input from security or international partners. CBSA maintains and\nprovides data on immigration violation rates that is shared with CIC. Statistics Canada tourism\nvolumes are also used to compare data collected internally to the total number of travellers from a\ngiven country. Collectively, this data is used to inform the need for further investigation through\nthe country review process. Overall, many interviewees felt that CIC’s ongoing monitoring was adequate.",
  "19": "While CIC regularly\nreceives data from its security partners, interviewees noted that, as a result of the separation of\nCBSA and CIC in 2003, CIC must rely on partners for a great deal of information. The\neffectiveness of this information-sharing relies on working relationships that are built between\npartners. Some interviewees note that, at times, good information-sharing exists between partners,\nbut it might not always be as proactive as it could be. 12 Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. 13\nAppropriateness of country review\n Country reviews can be carried out for a number of reasons. Some of these reasons include:\n When either the grant or removal of a visitor visa exemption is under consideration;\n A change in the thresholds as identified through ongoing monitoring, including changes in\npatterns of immigration violations or in–Canada asylum refugee claim rates;\n An identified change in country conditions, including changes in organized crime, a country’s\nsecurity situation, or national security concerns;\n An identified change in document security, integrity or misuse of documents;\n A request from a foreign government received via the Department of Foreign Affairs and\nInternational Trade (DFAIT) or another department. Country review reports are developed to support recommendations and the development of\nregulations. There is no established schedule for country reviews. Unlike the process in the U.S.,\nwhich is embedded in legislation and requires a country review of visa-exempt countries every two\nyears, Canada’s visa review schedules are based on ongoing monitoring and employ a flexible,\nrisk-based country review schedule. In interviews, most of the stakeholders mentioned that this\napproach is more adaptable, focused, and efficient than the U.S. process. A country review consists of an assessment of all or a majority of indicators under the seven\ncriteria. A document review is carried out using information obtained from various sources, as per\nthe ongoing country monitoring process described above. When considering granting a visa\nexemption, a technical visit to a country under consideration may be undertaken; however, this is\nnot typically conducted in advance of removing a visa exemption. Technical Visit Delegations are\nworking groups sent to specific countries to conduct technical visits. These delegations, which seek\nto resolve specific information gaps and issues of concern, bring together, on the Canadian side,\nthose equipped to ask probing questions and assess local conditions and, on the host country side,\nthose officials who can answer questions and address issues. Canadian delegation members are\ntypically drawn from groups within CIC, anti-counterfeiting officers from within the RCMP,\nmembers of Public Safety Canada, and representatives from Canada’s relevant embassies,\nconsulates, and/or high commissions. These visits are performed to confirm existing information\nand/or to close information gaps, and would include, for example, visiting passport production\ncentres to validate the security of passport production and distribution.",
  "20": "These visits were perceived\nby some interviewees as helpful in creating contacts with government representatives of the\naffected countries, and providing an opportunity to not only gather data but explain the criteria and\nthe rationale for the potential change. A review of the country reports for each case study country revealed that quantitative indicator\ninformation was available in all of the cases, while qualitative indicator information was limited. It\nwas not clear whether this lack of qualitative indicator data suggests that a judgement was made\nregarding the usefulness/quality of the data, or whether there was an inability to collect desired\ninformation. Some interview respondents noted that CIC always looks at the same issues consistently for all\ncountries, which was viewed as positive. They noted that evidence is not always weighed equally in\nthe country review process (i.e., some indicators are more significant in certain countries); a feature\nthat allows for more flexibility and is inherent in the review framework. 14\n3.2.3. Partner consultations\nWhile CIC is the federal government department responsible for developing visitor visa policy,\nconsultations with internal, external and international partners take place to support the\nrecommendations. This section examines to what extent those consultations are adequate. Finding: CIC engages appropriate partners and there is adequate collaboration to inform visa\nrecommendations; some OGDs feel that they are not engaged early enough in the process or that\ntheir views have not always been reflected in the final decision. Mechanisms for partner engagement\nInternally, within CIC two main branches are involved:\n Admissibility Branch has overall responsibility for visitor visa policy development, including\nconsultations with partners;\n International Region is responsible for processing visitor visa applications and is consulted\non visa-related policy issues. Other internal CIC units play a supporting role in terms of consultations, and the provision of\ninformation or advice. Other external partners involved in policymaking include DFAIT, the\nDepartment of Public Safety (PS), the CBSA, RCMP, and CSIS, and may, when relevant, included\nothers such as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), the Department of Justice Canada\n(DoJ), Industry Canada (IC), and Transport Canada (TC). International stakeholders participate in\nthe discussions on the development of visa policies, or are interested in decisions on changes in visa\nrequirements. The work of CIC in reviewing country conditions and generating recommendations regarding visa\nrequirements is facilitated by several working groups. The domestic working groups involve\nrelevant branches within CIC and OGDs mentioned above. Some examples of Canada’s\ninternational engagement include the Canada-United States Visa Policy Working Group (VPWG),\nwhich hold regular consultations, exchange information, and share best practices with regard to\nvisa, admissibility, and screening policies; and the Canada-Czech Expert Working Group, which\nwas set up to discuss visa issues and conditions following the decision to remove the visa\nexemption for the Czech Republic in 2009. Effectiveness of partner engagement\nAnalysis of the engagement mechanisms and the range of stakeholders involved indicates that\nappropriate partners are included in consultations that support the development of visa policy and\nrecommendations.",
  "21": "Stakeholders included in this process represent both sides of the visa\ncontinuum; those that focus on the facilitation of travel and those that focus on the\nsecurity/protection of Canadians. The majority of interviewees (both CIC and OGDs) felt that the\nmechanisms through which CIC engages and collaborates with program partners and stakeholders\nto inform visa recommendations are generally sufficient. It is important to note that many OGD\ninterviewees commented that the majority of engagement has been ad hoc (they are involved only\nwhen a visa policy recommendation is moving forward or when information is needed) and that\nthey are not engaged as early in the process as they would like. The reason for this lack of early\nengagement, as reported by some CIC interviewees, is the difficulty in managing the engagement\nprocess within the short timeframes that accompany visa recommendations, and the level of\n15\nsensitivity surrounding proposals. Because visa policy decisions are secret and are developed closely\nwith partners, CIC only brings key internal stakeholders in at the start and eventually expands\nconsultations outwards. Many OGD interviewees stated that while they are engaged in the discussions to inform visa\nrecommendations, they felt that their stance was often not reflected in the final decision. There is a\nlot of consultation, but the perception was that there is a need for further integration – a\nwhole-of-government approach. It was perceived that the role of OGDs in an integrated visa\npolicy remains an idea, not a reality. Interviewees at CIC commented that, while partners may feel\nthey are not sufficiently included, from a departmental perspective, their input is sought as needed. 3.2.4. Visa policy recommendations\nThe immediate outcome of the visa policy development, monitoring and consultations result in\nrecommendations that are to be evidence-based, risks based and consultative. This section\nexamines the extent to which this is achieved. As a result of the country review process and consultations with stakeholders, as described in the\nprevious section, a recommendation may be made to the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and\nMulticulturalism, who would make the final decision. This recommendation would be to:\n Maintain the status quo;\n Remove the visa exemption for nationals from that country; or\n Grant a visa exemption. There may also be further recommendations on the conditions imposed or actions taken, to better\nbalance the desire to facilitate the entry of bona fide travellers to Canada with the need to ensure the\nhealth, safety, and security of Canadians.",
  "22": "These could include:\n Continued monitoring of a country’s conditions;\n Implementing a public awareness campaign regarding the reviewed country;\n Assigning a CBSA Liaison Officer to the country; and/or\n Granting a visa exemption to particular nationals that possess specific types of travel\ndocuments.13\nOverall, the process of developing recommendations and changing regulations can be lengthy for a\nnumber of reasons: the conditions are monitored to assess longer-term trends, each individual\nchange must be accompanied by appropriate regulatory documents, and there exists a necessity to\nmanage relations with the affected country. 13 Government of Canada, 2008. Canada Gazette, vol. 142, no. 26 – December 24, 2008. “Regulations Amending the\nImmigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Visa exemption requirements for Lithuania and Poland).”\ngazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2008/2008-12-24/html/sor-dors308-eng.html\n16\nFinding: Monitoring and evidence from country reviews are regularly used to support visa policy\nrecommendations and the regulatory process. However, evidence is ultimately weighed and other\ninternal and external factors play a part in the final decision to impose or lift a visa. Evidence-based, risk-based and consultative recommendations\nA review of documents for the four case study countries indicates that recommendations appeared\nto be informed by the evidence collected through monitoring and country review processes. Many\ninterviewees also confirmed that information collected from country review and monitoring\nprocesses is used to support visa requirement recommendations. While the evidence is always taken into account, the information/evidence is ultimately weighed\nand a holistic assessment is used, rather than focusing on one factor that may be not in line with\nthresholds. The use of evidence is particularly noticeable in cases of removing the visa exemptions,\nwith Mexico and Czech Republic having significantly surpassed key risk thresholds. In case of\nPoland, the decision was to grant an exemption, even though the country surpassed at least one of\nthe thresholds (10% refusal rate) and there were concerns related to passport security. The passport\nrisks were subsequently addressed with the additional e-passport requirement regulation. Some interviewees held that, in some cases, evidence from monitoring and country reviews may be\nused to support country-level visa requirement changes that had already been considered as a result\nof other pressures/political considerations. Even in those cases, country reviews were conducted\nand evidence was gathered to support the decision by providing a risk assessment. Many interviewees suggested that other factors come to bear on the final decision to remove a visa\nexemption or grant a visa exemption by the Cabinet and the decision to change a visa requirement\nis also strongly informed by GOC interests and priorities. The final decision is seen as a question of\nthe right balance and the right timing. In the cases of Taiwan and Mexico, evidence in support of\nthe visa exemption and the removal of the visa exemption existed for several years before the actual\nchange was made. In the case of Hungary, where asylum claims rates have surpassed the threshold\nfor several years, the recommendation to re-impose a visa is not being addressed.",
  "23": "This suggests that\nthe decision to grant an exemption or re-impose a visa is carefully considered within a context of\nother national and international factors. Regulatory processes\nAfter the recommendation is approved by the Minister, a regulatory change to section 190 of the\nIRPR is required. This must be accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Assessment Statement (RIAS)\nprepared by the Regulatory Affairs Unit at CIC. The RIAS explains the background and the\nrationale for a decision, as well as the alternatives, provides a cost and benefit analysis, details the\nconsultative process that informed the decision, describes the compliance and enforcement\nrequired, and explains what the impacts of the decision could be, and the risks and benefits of the\nregulatory change. The evaluation examined RIASs prepared for each case study to assess the use\nof evidence to support the regulatory change. An analysis of RIASs for the four case study\ncountries confirm that the information contained within the RIASs was largely informed by the\nevidence gathered though monitoring and country reviews. One of the weaknesses of RIAS documents is the cost-benefit analysis section. While the section\naddresses additional impacts to Canada, such as the impact on the Canadian economy, social\nassistance costs, or costs that will be incurred by other federal departments, most of the analysis is\n17\nfairly qualitative and does not provide a quantitative assessment of these impacts (Technical\nappendix). While there may be challenges in assessing the cost/value of some of the elements, such\nas deterrence of irregular migration, other elements, such as aggregated cost to the asylum claim\nprocessing, or the loss to economy may be easier to assess using quantitative estimates. The\nintention of the cost-benefit analysis as per the Canadian Cost-Benefit Analysis Guide for\nRegulatory Proposals (TBS, 2007) is to quantify both the costs and benefits of the regulatory\nchange, the current method, which focuses largely on qualitative descriptors, reduces the strength\nof the evidence. 3.3. Performance – Implementation\nThe responsibility for processing visitor visas lies with CIC’s Operations Sector, which is divided\ninto domestic and overseas operations. Overseas operations fall under the responsibility of the\nInternational Region and its network of visa offices abroad. Processing of visitor visas takes place at\nCanadian visa offices overseas;14 only visitor visa extensions are processed in Canada. Visa offices\nare usually located within a Canadian mission (e.g., embassies, high commissions). Administrative services are shared with DFAIT under the terms of a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding, whereby CIC transfers resources to DFAIT to secure accommodation and some\nadministrative support. Some visa offices offer a full range of processing, while others offer limited\nprocessing services (for example only permanent or temporary resident applications). The office\nmay cover one or more countries. In large countries like China, India and the U.S., the volume of\napplications is such that there is more than one office to serve each country.",
  "24": "Applications from\nclients must be directed to the office in their country of permanent residence or in a country to\nwhich they were lawfully admitted. CIC processing of TRVs is guided by the Operations Manual (OP 11). According to the Manual,\ntemporary resident applications will be given as much priority as possible within the restraints imposed by other\nprocessing priorities at the visa office. All applications are reviewed and decided on a case-by-case basis. The applicant is required to satisfy the visa officer that their visit to Canada is temporary, they will\nnot overstay their approved time in Canada, they hold a passport or travel document, have\nsufficient financial means to support their stay in Canada, are in good health, do not have a criminal\nrecord, and that they are not a security risk to Canadians. Each application for a visitor visa is processed abroad, but each person is also examined, to various\ndegrees, at the port of entry by the border officer. The foreign nationals must satisfy the border\nofficer that they have both the ability and the willingness to leave Canada at the end of the period\nfor which they are authorized to remain in Canada and that they will not engage in activities that are\nnot authorized by the visitor visa – i.e., work, study, or apply for permanent residency from within\nCanada. 14 There are three categories of visa offices or missions abroad: regional program centres (RPCs), full-service centres,\nand satellites and specialized offices. RPCs and full-service centres both deliver the full range of immigration services\nfor the countries they serve, but RPCs also oversee satellite offices. The full range of immigration services includes the\nprocessing of permanent and temporary resident applications as well as other immigration applications, such as\nrequests for travel documents or temporary resident permits. Satellites and specialized program offices do not deliver\nthe full range of immigration services. 18\n3.3.1. Processing\nTo facilitate the flow of temporary residents, visa offices need to meet the demand for TRVs. The\nfollowing section describes the performance of the Program as it relates to the processing of visitor\nvisas. This includes a description of trends in demand, visitor visa processing trends and ability to\nalign capacity with fluctuations in demand and visa policy changes. Finding: CIC has been able to meet the processing demand for TRVs to date with some extension of\ntime required to process applications. While CIC has the capacity to address seasonal fluctuations,\naddressing major regulatory changes requires additional resources. Recent streamlining initiatives\nshow some positive effects on processing activities; however, it is too early to assess their\nlong-term impact. Demand for temporary resident visas\nThe following section demonstrates that the overall number of TRV applications has increased\nsince 2006, although these increases are more apparent in certain regions, and that travel patterns\nfluctuate seasonally.",
  "25": "As a result of this demand and fluctuations, the impetus is placed on CIC to\nfind ways to meet this demand by taking into account travel patterns and leverage the benefits\n(economic, social, etc.) associated with temporary travel to Canada. Demand for TRVs can fluctuate in response to changes in economic conditions, regional and\nseasonal travel patterns, and changes to visa requirements. The number of applications for\ntemporary resident visas remained fairly stable from 2006 to 2010, with a slight dip in 2008 and\n2009, presumably as a result of the economic recession (see Figure 3-1). In 2010, there was an\nincrease in the number of visa applications (by approximately 130,000 applications) compared to\nthe previous year. Fifty percent of this increase was the result of the removal of the visa exemption\non nationals of Mexico in mid-2009. Additionally, an analysis of the data shows that, in general, there are different trends in the demand\nfor TRV applications per region over the years under review. As shown in Figure 3-1, the number\nof applications received in the Americas Region recently surpassed the number from Asia and\nPacific. While applications received by European offices decreased, there was a slight increase in\napplications received from African and Middle Eastern countries. Figure 3-1: Applications received by region (2006-1010)\n350,000\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n0\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nAsia & Pacific Americas Europe Africa and Middle East\nSource: OPS Statistics, CIC\n19\nWhile the overall number of applications remains relatively stable, the rate of change in the number\nof applications received for particular missions has been quite high. In addition to changes by region and by mission, travel patterns fluctuate seasonally with a higher\nnumber of travellers in the summer months. This pattern is consistent across all regions (see Figure\n3-2). Figure 3-2: Application patterns within a year\n140,000\nAfrica and Middle East\n120,000\nAsia & Pacific\n100,000\nEurope\n80,000\nAmericas\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n0\nOct/ Nov/ Dec/ Jan/ Feb/ Mar/ Apr/ May/ Jun/ Jul/ Aug/ Sep/\n2010 2010 2010 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011\nSource: OPS Statistics, CIC\nAbility to meet TRV demand\nIn order to assess CIC’s ability to meet the demand for TRV applications, the evaluation examined\nTRV processing statistics and CIC resource capacity. Processing rates: As shown in Figure 3-3, which compares the number of applications processed to\nthe number of applications received, a large majority of applications are processed to completion;\nhowever, there has been a slight decline in processing rates in 2009 and 2010; 98% of files were\nprocessed in 2007 compared to 95% in 2010. The percentage of unprocessed applications relates\nmostly to the fact that applications received at the end of the year may only be processed in the\nfollowing year.",

From 2006 to 2010 processing times (for\n80% of cases) have increased from 7 to 14 days, overall, and in almost all regions (see Table 3-1). An analysis of processing times for the 65 offices that existed between 2006 and 2010 shows that:\n Processing times increased in almost 50% of the offices, decreased in 14%, and remained the\nsame in 38%;\n The highest increases in processing times were in Islamabad (from 14 days to 56), Tehran (from\n28 to 42 days), Abidjan (from 7 to 21 days);\n The largest decreases in processing times were in Warsaw (from 7 days to same-day processing\ndue to the granting of the visa exemption), Guatemala (from 14 to 7 day processing), Harare\n(from 42 days to same-day processing), and Chandigarh (from 28 to 14 days);\n In 2006 there were 15 (22%) offices that processed applications within one day; this number\ndecreased to 9 (14%) in 2008, where it remained for the rest of the period under review. Processing times are influenced by the number of applications received, the level of effort to\nprocess visa applications in certain areas and whether additional health or security screening is\nundertaken. Some interviewees suggested that one of the reasons for longer processing times\nrelates to the time it takes for CIC’s partners to perform security and health checks.

As previously noted, some trends in TRV\nprocessing indicate that CIC’s performance has declined slightly over the last five years (i.e. increased processing times, decreased processing rates). Some interviewees suggested that while\nCIC manages to meet the demand, at some point CIC will not be able to cope with processing more\nTRVs without increasing resources or compromising security/program integrity, due to\ninsufficient human resources issues. Capacity to process TRVs\nIn total, the number of visa offices that process applications has remained fairly constant (68 offices\nin 2006 and 65 in 2010)15.",
  "27": "Visa offices generally consist of an Immigration Program Manager (IPM),\none to two Deputy IPM/Operations Managers, and several Canada-Based Officers (CBOs). There\n15 After office closures in 2012, the number of offices is currently 56. 21\nare also Locally Engaged Program Officers (LEPs), Locally Engaged Staff (LESs) and local\nadministrative staff. Circa 2011, there were approximately 340 CBOs and 1,320 locally-engaged\nstaff working for the immigration program abroad (including those performing CIC and CBSA\nrelated tasks). There are significant variations in terms of how many countries and people each of\nthe visa offices include. For instance, the mission in Singapore is responsible for a territory that\ncovers 600 million people in 10 countries and is staffed with eight CBOs and 28 LESs. The biggest\nmission, in New Delhi, has 150 staff, including 28 CBOs. To assess CIC’s capacity to process TRV applications, the evaluation examined the level of\noperational support provided by CIC; whether CIC has the HR capacity to adjust to meet visitor\nvisa demand fluctuation. Operational support: Materials are available to inform staff about operational procedures, policy\nchanges, and any other form of change occurring in the IR network. Ongoing support is provided\nby NHQ and bulletins are published throughout the network to ensure that staff are aware of any\nchanges. Recent initiatives include the Wiki page for international staff, which includes a section on\nquestions and best practices. Recent audits (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011) of visa programs in nine\nmissions suggest that the decisions are made by the appropriate level of staff and that staff followed\nthe required procedures. Overall ability to adjust TRV workload: The first concern mentioned by CIC interviewees was\nworkload pressures related to TRV processing. In particular, because visa processing units are\nstaffed based on permanent resident applications processing levels, TRVs are treated as a lesser\npriority. The focus is to ensure that the processing of permanent resident applications allows CIC\nto meet the stated permanent immigration targets. There are no targets associated with TRVs. Due\nto the fact that staffing is done through an interdepartmental committee for overseas staff, creating\none position in the field takes about one year. This results in a lack of flexibility or responsiveness as\nit is a cumbersome process to reassign permanent staff to missions and even more difficult to add\na position. Instead, resources are shifted between permanent and temporary processing and other\nstrategies are used to address workload challenges. In internal CIC reports for 2010, difficulty with\nprocessing due to increased demand was mentioned by managers of almost all missions. Ability to meet TRV demands due to annual/seasonal fluctuations: The majority of\ninterviewees commented that while there are some challenges, overall, CIC has the ability to meet\nvisa processing demands due to annual/seasonal fluctuations. In general, January to September is\nconsidered temporary season; students are also included in this group because they have to get their\nvisas in the spring in order to attend school.",
  "28": "When the demand for temporary resident visas\nincreases in the spring and summer, mission resources are shifted from processing PR applications\nto TRVs. In general, many missions focus on processing permanent resident applications in the low\nseason (winter, early spring). Ability to meet TRV demand due to changes to visa regulations: Respondents were divided\nwhen asked whether CIC has the ability to meet visa processing demands due to changes in visa\nregulations. Many interviewwws noted that the sufficiency in resources to meet the new demand\nrelating to a visa imposition depends on the country on which it was imposed (size, yearly number\nof travellers to Canada, etc.). While the majority believe that Mexico received sufficient resources,\nthis is not always the case. An examination of the Mexico and Czech Republic case studies show\nthat while there were some initial challenges, sufficient resources were provided to address the\ndemand. 22\n Mexico: Prior to the removal of the visa exemption, there was one immigration program\nmanager, two visa officers, a migration anti-fraud officer and some locally engaged staff\nworking in the immigration section of the mission in Mexico. During this period, the majority\nof processing work related to permanent resident applications, study and work permits. According to interviewees, after the removal of the visa exemption, the office increased its\nnumber of staff to approximately 70 people almost overnight. In the year since the imposition,\nthere were more than 100 temporary duty (TD) officers that operated in the Mexico office; the\ncycle of officers coming to Mexico was between one to three months each, from the date the\nvisa exemption was removed until about September 2010. Because the majority of processing\nofficers sent from Canada for the first year were TD officers, some interviewees said that the\nhigh turnover made it more difficult to manage. After the first year, the office became more\nstable with a steady team of people, receiving officers who will likely remain in the office for 2-3\nyears, who can understand Spanish, and who had the time to understand the socio-economic\nsituation in Mexico and apply this to their work. As illustrated in Figure 3-4, below, the mission\nin Mexico processed almost all applications received within the first two years of the visa\nchange. Figure 3-4: Mexico: applications received vs. applications processed\n70,000\n60,000\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n2009 2010\nApplications received Total processed\nSource: OPS Statistics, CIC\n Czech Republic: In the case of the Czech Republic, processing was delegated to CIC’s Vienna,\nAustria office. Recognizing that it would be a significant change for Czech nationals to have to\napply for a visa in another country, various avenues were created to submit applications. However, in order to be more responsive to concerns raised by Czech nationals, CIC\nintroduced a two-person office in Prague (1 CBO and 1 LES). While the Vienna office could\nhave handled Czech applications, the Prague office was necessary to improve client service and\nCanada’s reputation.",
  "29": "In 2010, the mission in Czech Republic processed 99.3% of all the\napplications received.16\n16 2009 data for the Czech nationals was not available, as applications were processed by the Vienna mission (data is\navailable by mission rather than nationality). 23\nMain mitigation strategies to address capacity challenges\nAs previously noted, there are challenges in managing TRV resources because missions are funded\nbased on their permanent workload and because TRV demand fluctuates. Therefore, CIC employs\na number of different strategies to mitigate capacity challenges, such as Temporary Duty (TD)\narrangements, and introducing streamlining processes; such as VACs, and multiple entry and\nlonger term visas. Temporary Duty: CIC relies on TD officers to mitigate capacity challenges in missions due to\nannual/seasonal demand, visa requirement changes and other factors. TD officers are staff with\nseveral years’ experience working at CIC, who receive theoretical and practical training on\nprocessing immigration applications. These individuals are assigned to process applications to\nrelieve officers during the busy season, or to replace those on leave. While the TD officer is\nintended to assist with processing, this practice has other positive effects, such allowing the TD\nofficer, who may have a substantive position in the policy sector, to bring back to their branch their\nexperience learned working in an operational environment. This should help inform future policy\nwork. Over the last few years, the overall number of TD assignments (for TR, PR, etc.) has\nincreased from 133 in 2007 to 341 in 2010 and number of work weeks from 723 to 1740 with a\nminimum of 30% of those allocated to processing temporary applications. Streamlining processes\nVisa Application Centre (VAC): VACs are independent service providers and international\norganizations that are operated on a user-pay basis by third-party service providers, and that charge\nuser fees (at levels set by the service provided and agreed by CIC) to assist clients with the visa\napplication process. Canada is currently served by 60 VACs in 41 countries. VACs have two main\nobjectives: to facilitate in-person assistance for clients and to support the ability of CIC to meet the\ndemand for TRVs. This section focuses on the use of VACs to support demand/capacity\nchallenges within missions (the facilitation objective will be discussed in the section on facilitation). In its support role to CIC, VACs are intended to improve missions’ processing capacity by\nproviding administrative support services to applicants. VAC staff are strictly prohibited from\nproviding evaluative advice or consultancy and play no role in the decision-making process. In\nBeijing and Mexico, VACs have the ability to scan applications with 2D barcodes, which is\nuploaded to the system in Ottawa, validated, and provided to mission through GCMS to facilitate\nprocessing of applications. While definitive, quantitative information on their success was not\navailable for the evaluation, based on the interviews from the mission in Mexico, the VAC has had\na positive impact on addressing demand and capacity challenges.",
  "30": "In particular, staff at the Mexico\nmission mentioned that VAC contributes to the completeness of application packages, which\nreduces the rejection rate for incomplete/incorrect forms. This provides staff with time to\nconcentrate on assessing complete applications. While staff positively assessed the impact of the\nVAC on operations, an internal review of the Mexico VAC files for July/August 2010, in which\n1,000 applications were reviewed, indicated that the applications received from VAC in Mexico had\na 78% error rate, and 43% of these applications were incomplete. However, corrective measures\nwere taken by mission staff to provide feedback to VACs on the most frequent mistakes and\nsubsequently the error rates has significantly reduced. This underlines the importance of regular\nfeedback and communication between the visa offices and VACs. . 24\nOther Changes: There are other mechanisms being introduced that are intended to improved\nCIC’s processing capacity and efficiency. Examples include: long-term and multiple-entry visas,\nwhich aims to decrease the number of transactions with clients; e-applications (2D barcodes); and\nthe introduction of a new system to collect data on applications, Global Case Management System\n(GCMS), which includes features such as uploadable information and group processing. While the\nmissions expressed some concerns that GCMS added processing time, particularly during the file\ncreation process, during the Mexico site visit interviewees commented positively about the initial\nimpacts of these mechanisms, however, the longer term impact will have to be assessed when more\ninformation is available. 3.3.2. Communications\nThere are three main communication activities related to visitor visas: communicating application\nrequirements to potential TRV clients, communications related to changes in visa regulations, and\ncommunications related to sensitive TRV cases. As it was not possible to locate temporary visitor\napplicants (due to privacy and cost issues), the evaluation could not gather their direct assessment\nof the impact of communication activities; therefore, this section relies on qualitative assessment of\nthe breadth and depth of communication efforts. Finding: The timeliness and breadth of CIC’s communication strategies related to immigration are\nreasonable and address a variety of potential client’ information needs. As materials supporting\ndecisions on changes to visa requirements are subject to Cabinet confidence, CIC faces\ncommunication constraints related to the timing of information being released to partners,\nstakeholders and to the public. Communication: visitor visa application requirements\nTo assess regular communications, the evaluation conducted interviews, a document review, and a\nreview of the information available on-line to assess the comprehensiveness and breadth of the\ninformation provided. The evaluation found that information regarding temporary resident visas is\nreadily available online and the CIC website appears comprehensive and provides information that\nmay be helpful to those who have access to the internet. In particular, CIC’s website provides\ninformation for potential clients on current visa requirements, as well as any changes introduced.17\nThis information includes links to application forms and guides, TRV exemptions, processing\ntimes, and means of extending one’s stay in Canada. Additional information is contained on\nmission specific websites, including information on temporary travel requirements.",
  "31": "Missions\nprovide information in English and French but also sometimes in local languages. These websites\nhave a common look and feel and the information provided is almost identical. One issue noted in\nsome interviews was that some complaints were received from clients in Mexico about TRV forms\nonly being available in English and French, which made them difficult for clients to complete. Communicating changes regarding visitor visas regulations\nInformation about proposed regulatory changes to visa requirements is made available through the\nCanada Gazette. Key stakeholder groups within Canada, such as provincial and territorial ministries\nof immigration, as well as the Canadian Council for Refugees, are subsequently provided notice of\n17 See, for example, www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/index.asp and\nwww.canadainternational.gc.ca/mexico-mexique/visas/index.aspx?lang=eng&menu_id=5. Note that mission\nwebsites are provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 25\nthese changes by a departmental spokesperson. Communications are also undertaken for the\nbenefit of the Canadian public – both the general public and those who may have business or family\nties to the affected country. These communications include an explanation of the rationale for the\ndecision. In addition to these governmental channels, news of visa requirement changes is often\ndisseminated through Canadian media, whose reporting of the changes may include reference to\nprepared communications materials and/or comments from departmental spokespeople. The level\nof public notification with respect to visa requirement changes is lower than for other forms of\nregulatory change, as the visa policy process itself is sensitive owing to the national and\ninternational information involved. Timing of visa requirement change communication\nDue to the sensitive nature of decisions to remove a visa exemption, they are communicated at the\nlast possible moment to prevent a surge in travel (and, potentially, in-Canada asylum claims) by\ncitizens of affected countries. Communication materials are prepared well in advance of the\nannouncement. Because visa requirement changes come into effect very shortly after their public\nannouncement, these requirements must be communicated swiftly to reduce the risk of traveller\nconfusion abroad. Nevertheless, according to some interviewees, because of the short notice of\nthese types of changes, travellers who are travelling the day of, or shortly after, the announcement\ncan face difficulties getting their visas in time for the travel. It should be mentioned that CIC usually\nallows a grace period of a few days for these circumstances. A review of documents and interviews pertaining to the Mexico and Taiwan visa decisions show\nthat there is an approach to consult with affected international stakeholders with respect to visa\ndecisions. In the Mexico case study, the ambassador and staff at the Canadian mission were highly\ninvolved, not only in informing their counterparts about the decision, but also in providing the\nrationale for such a decision. In the case of Mexico, while CIC put some public notices in the\npapers, it also benefited from existing media interest in the issue.",
  "32": "The public appeared to be fairly\nwell-informed about the need to apply for visa as evidenced by large line-ups in front of the\nembassy the day the announcement was made. Many interviewees from the mission and NHQ felt\nthat the Mexico visa change was effectively communicated. Some mission staff commented that the\nlarge number of Mexican citizens applying for a visa immediately after the imposition was an\nindication that they were aware of the new requirement. 3.4. Performance – Achieving integrity and facilitation outcomes\nUsing data from interviews, administrative systems and case studies, the evaluation examined the\nextent to which CIC’s Visa Policy Program contributed to the achievement of the intermediate\noutcome of the visa program: protection of the integrity of Canada’s immigration and asylum\nsystems and facilitation of travel for bona-fide travellers as well as balancing both. 3.4.1. Integrity of the immigration system\nThe evaluation examined the following aspects of integrity:\nIntegrity of the immigration system: At the outcome level, the impact of the visa program on\nprotecting the integrity of the immigration system was assessed by looking at the effectiveness of\nthe Program in deterring non-bona fide travellers from applying, preventing irregular migration,\nand preventing immigration violations. 26\nIntegrity of the asylum and refugee system: The impact of the Visa Program on the integrity of\nthe asylum and refugee system was assessed by examining the effect of the visa on asylum claim\nrates, especially those presumed to be unfounded, and the costs/savings associated with processing\nsuch claims. Finding: The visitor visa is an effective tool that helps protect the integrity of CIC’s immigration\nand asylum system through selecting low-risk countries for visa-free travel, and potentially being a\ndeterrent for non-bona fide travellers. Its role as a mechanism to address immigration violations is\nless certain. The impact of the visitor visa on irregular migration is difficult to measure due to lack\nof data on certain indicators (e.g., overstays)\nDeterrence effect\nThe existence of a visa plays a role in preventing people who may not meet eligibility/admissibility\ncriteria from applying. Interviewees noted that the existence or re-imposition of a visa requirement\non a country is a deterrent for non-bona fide travellers. They noted that a visa requirement in theory\nshould have a self-selection or deterrence effect on ineligible/inadmissible travellers to Canada. This is supported by evidence in the case study countries (e.g., Czech Republic and Mexico). While\nit is difficult to generalize and quantify this effect across all visa-required countries, travel patterns\nafter removing the visa exemptions suggests that there is a link between visa requirements and\ndeterrence of non-bona fide travel. For example, in the Czech Republic, visa refusal rates were very\nlow when a visa was required; in 2010, the TRV refusal rate for Czech Republic nationals was\naround 1%. This may suggest that potential applicants self-assess their likelihood of obtaining a visa\nto come to Canada.",
  "33": "Irregular migration\nOnce visitors obtain a visa and gain entry into Canada, they must comply with the terms and\nconditions of their stay: they should not engage in unauthorized activities, such as work and/or\nstudy; they should leave the country as stated; and they should not use their temporary entry to\npursue permanent residency. Any temporary visitor who pursues other activities is in direct conflict\nwith conditions of admission, which undermines the integrity of the immigration program. Due to the weaknesses of the data collection system, it is not possible to assess the number of\npeople who remain in Canada longer than authorized (overstays), those who engage in illegal work\nwhile under temporary visitor status, or those that apply for permanent residence while in the\ncountry. While CIC considers these indicators relevant to measure irregular migration as described\nin its PAA, Canada and many other peer countries do not have exit control systems, so it is difficult\nto know how many people remain in the country when their period of authorized stay ends. In\n2008, the Auditor General report estimated that there were 63,000 people with enforceable\nremoval orders in Canada; however, since there is no information on who has left the country, the\nnumber of illegal migrants may be higher. The report stated that Canada does not monitor the exit of\ntravellers from the country, and therefore (..) does not know whether individuals have left the country as required in their\ntemporary permit.18\n18 Auditor General Report, Chapter 5 – Citizenship and Immigration Canada – Control and Enforcement. www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200304_05_e_12911.html\n27\nImmigration violations\nImmigration violations are documented infractions of Canadian immigration laws, such as\ninterceptions of individuals en route to Canada, of inadmissible individuals identified at a Canadian\nport of entry and those identified in Canada. In this section, immigration violation rates, for both\nvisa-required and visa exempt countries, are compared in order to determine whether the visa has\nbeen successful at protecting the integrity of Canada’s immigration system. Inadmissible travellers\nattempt to enter Canada on an ongoing and regular basis, which presents a risk to the integrity of\nCanada’s immigration system. The risks are that travellers may repeat previous unlawful\nbehaviours, or that admitting those with criminal records will tarnish Canada’s international\nreputation by suggesting that it is a country that provides a haven for serious criminals. Another risk\nis that people with health risks will either directly impact the health of Canadians (e.g. through the\nspread of tuberculosis) or will constitute a drain on public health services (e.g. through treatment\nfor chronic illnesses or conditions). Table 3-2 and Table 3-3 show that the number of immigration violations remains fairly comparable\nbetween visa exempt (EXM) and visa-required (REQ) countries, with the exception of intercepts\n(improperly documented people en route to Canada).",
  "34": "However, comparing the rates of\nimmigration violations from visa exempt and visa-required countries must take into account that\nthe majority of international travel to Canada comes from visa exempt countries (between 95% to\n97% of annual travel volumes depending on the year – see Number of Travellers statistics in Table\n3-2). Therefore, while the number of violations is comparable, immigration violation rates are\nmuch lower for visa exempt countries. As noted in Table 3-2, the rate of immigration violations\nfrom visa exempt countries is 14 to 20 times lower than visa-required countries depending on the\nyear. This suggests that visa exempt countries were appropriately selected for visa-free travel as they\ndo not pose the same level of risk in term of immigration violations. These numbers also indicate that a visa requirement does not completely eliminate immigration\nviolations, which would presumably be higher if a visa exemption had been granted. Data from the\nCzech Republic and Mexico case studies support this presumption. The highest rates of\nimmigration violations for the Czech Republic occurred in the years following the granting of the\nvisa exemption (from 2007 to 2009) primarily as a result of the high number of asylum claims. The\nimmigration violation rate then diminished following the removal of the visa exemption in 2009. For both the Czech Republic and Mexico, the years following the removal of the visa exemption\nalign with a drop in the immigration violation rate, therefore suggesting that visas are effective in\nreducing immigration violation rates. In terms of the impact of granting visa exemptions, there was\nno noticeable increase or decrease in immigration violation rates is the cases of Taiwan and Poland. Therefore, there was no impact on the integrity of the immigration system. While the data shows\nthat both visa exempt and visa-required countries are sources of immigration violations, the\nremoval of the visa exemption helped control the immigration violation rate in the case of Mexico\nand the Czech Republic. However, it is difficult to determine the degree to which immigration\nviolations would change (increase) without visa requirements for current visa-required countries.",

These rates relate to cases identified en route to Canada (intercepts) and those that are identified at the\nport of entry or inland (A44 and R4219). These rates do not include inadmissible cases identified in missions abroad. It is important to note that the majority of visitors to Canada do not pose much of a threat to\nCanadians. There are; however, individuals who may pose more direct risks to the Canadian public,\nsuch as those with previous criminal histories. Interviewees suggested that those with links to\norganized crime or human trafficking are of particular concern, as the individuals involved may\ncontinue unlawful activities within Canada. A comparison of the type of immigration violations\nbetween visa exempt and visa-required countries (see Table 3-2 and Table 3-3) shows that:\n Visa-exempt countries are not a major source of security or human right violations (related to\nsection A34-35 of IRPA).  The number of criminality-related inadmissibility cases (related to section 36 of IRPA) among\nvisa-exempt countries is higher than visa-required countries, suggesting that a visa requirement\nmay be effective in decreasing the number of criminality cases. 19 A44 inadmissibility cases are those relating to sections 34-42 of IRPA (See Table 4 for detailed categories. R42\ninadmissibility cases are those relating to determination if a foreign national could become a temporary or a permanent\nresident or make a claim for refugee protection; direct a person to leave Canada or to return to the United States; allow\nthe withdrawal of an application to enter Canada or refuse the entry to a person who does not satisfy the requirements\nof the Act; authorize a person to enter Canada for further examination or an admissibility hearing. 29\n The top country among non-visa-required countries with immigration violations is the United\nStates which accounts for about 75% of the total immigration violation rate. However, given\nthe volume of travellers from the U.S., the proportion of immigration violations from that\ncountry remains very low at 0.2%.",
  "36": " In Mexico, the number of immigration violations decreased significantly, from 9,000 in 2006 to\n3,500 in 2010, after the visa re-imposition. This may suggest that the re-imposition had an\neffect on either deterring or screening out inadmissible applicants/applications.

Even though the number of inadmissible cases for visa-required countries is not large, the\nfollowing questions remain: does this represent an acceptable level of risk? Should these cases have\nbeen identified abroad through health and security screening (even though some of the violations\nwill have occurred in Canada)? 3.4.2. Integrity of the asylum system\nCanada’s existing asylum system faces an ever-increasing number of new claims every year, with\nclaims taking years to process. The perceived generous nature of Canada’s asylum system may\nencourage submissions of unfounded asylum claims, which serves to reduce Canada’s ability to\nhelp those who truly need protection. The analysis below includes an assessment of the impact of\nthe visa on asylum claim rates as well as an analysis of claims made by the case study countries\nunder discussion. The impact of the visa program on the integrity of the asylum system was\nassessed by examining the effect of the visa on asylum claim rates and the costs/savings associated\nwith processing unfounded claims\n30\nAsylum claim rates\nCIC uses asylum claim rates as one of the quantitative thresholds to inform changes in visa\nrequirements and defines it as one of the indicators pertaining to Managed Migration outcome\nresults in the PAA/PMF document. Figure 3-5 shows that the proportion of asylum claims, from\nboth visa-required and visa-exempt countries, have shifted over time.",
  "37": "Even though the majority of\nclaims have consistently been from visa-required countries, from 2006 to 2008 there was nearly a\n20% increase in the proportion of asylum claims from visa exempt countries. This increase was\nmostly due to increasing numbers of asylum claims from Mexico. In 2009 and 2010, this trend was\nreversed due to the removal of the visa exemption granted to nationals of the Czech Republic and\nMexico, which were major sources of asylum claims. Furthermore, Figure 3-5 shows that there has\nbeen an overall increase in the total number of asylum claims from 2006 to 2009, followed by a\nlarge decrease in 2010, mainly resulting from the removal of the visa exemption for nationals of\nMexico. It is evident that CIC monitors and makes changes to the visa exemption list when\nnecessary; and when possible removing from this list countries that are becoming major sources of\nasylum claims.

Figure 3-6 shows the increase in\nMexican asylum claims from 2001 to 2008 (from 1,730 to 9,462 claims) and the significant decrease\nsince the removal of the visa exemption in July 2009 (from 7,570 claims in 2009 to 1,199 claims in\n2010). This represents a substantial decrease (87%) in asylum claims from 2008 to 2010. 31\nFigure 3-6: Total number of asylum claims made, by Mexican nationals in Canada\n10,000\n9,000\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\n5,000\n9,462\n4,000\n7,228 7,570\n3,000\n4,921\n2,000\n3,455\n2,597 2,810\n1,000 1,730 2,090\n1,199\n416\n0\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\n(Jan-\nSource: OPS Statistics, CIC Sep)\nTable 3-4, below, presents the proportion of asylum claims made (per year) by each case study\ncountry (2005 to 2010).

The removal of the visa exemption in 2009 resulted in a significant decrease\nin the proportion of asylum claims made in Canada coming from Czech nationals, from 6.58%\nto 0.18%.  Mexico: The removal of the visa exemption in 2009 was very effective in reducing the asylum\nclaim rate. In 2009, 23% of the asylum claims made in Canada were from Mexican nationals,\nwhich decreased to 4.7% in 2010 following the removal of the visa exemption.",
  "38": "It is expected\nthat the asylum claim rate will further diminish as many of the asylum claims that occurred after\nJuly 2009 (date of the removal of the visa exemption) could have been made by Mexican\nnationals present in Canada before the imposition.

Outcomes of asylum claims\nCIC’s mandate includes affording protection to people in need of protection. Therefore, reducing\nthe asylum claim rates alone is not sufficient to assess the effectiveness of the Visitor Visa Program\nin protecting the integrity of the asylum system. The evaluation examined the legitimacy of the\nclaims using asylum claim outcomes (rates of approval/refusal as adjudicated by the Immigration\nand Refugee Board (IRB), and withdrawal/abandonment by claimants). Overall, from 2000 to 2010, the asylum claim approval rate for all countries was around 43% (see\nTable 3-5). Over the period examined, Table 3-5 shows that asylum claim outcomes for all case\nstudy countries differed from this average. The proportion of negative decisions diverged the most\nin the case of the Czech Republic, with a rate half that of the 10-year overall average. In all other\ncase study countries, the proportion of negative outcomes was greater than the average. The case\nstudy countries also displayed higher rates of abandoned or withdrawn asylum claims than the\ninternational average. Unfortunately, data are not systematically collected on the reasons for the\nabandonment or withdrawal of asylum claims.

  "39": "If this is the case, then the imposition of a visa in these cases does contribute to\nprotecting the integrity of the asylum system. 3.4.3. Facilitation of travel\nThe following section assesses the achievement of the Visitor Visa Program’s facilitation objective. To assess this objective, the evaluation examined the extent to which the visa application process\nfacilitates travel, in comparison to other countries, and the impact of visa requirement changes on\ntravel patterns. This section also presents some mechanisms and tools that aim to facilitate travel to\nCanada for bona fide visitors. 33\nFinding: CIC’s Visitor Visa Program facilitates the movement of bona fide travellers, as evidenced\nby the fact that the TRV processing requirements are similar to those in other countries; by\nreaching CIC targets for approval rates; and by introducing other facilitative approaches and tools. Processing requirements\nThe visitor visa process and processing requirements can be a travel barrier if the process is not\ntimely and the requirements are more extensive than those used by other countries. Canada has\nfaced criticism from stakeholders, such as the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC), regarding the\nextensive information requirements. In 2010, CIC conducted an internally-led comparison study of\nthe TRV application processes and requirements between Canada and other countries competing\nfor international tourists. Information was gathered and analysed for the American, British, French\nand Australian visitor visa programs in certain key locations comparing processes and requirements\nfor nationals of China, India and Brazil. The study showed that Canada collected more information\nthan the other countries reviewed (see Table 3-6). It has the highest number of fields to be\ncompleted by applicants. Also, some information requested varies between different Canadian visa\noffices. For example, Details of Past Work Experience and Details of Travel History were not\nsystematically requested by visa officers in all missions. On the other hand, Canada asked a similar\nnumber of security questions as other countries and requests a similar number of supporting\ndocuments.

  "40": "* updated information\nNote: The information in the table presented on the Australia visa excludes eTA related processes\nThe study showed that Canada offers more options to submit an application, and the vast majority\nof applications are processed on paper without an interview. The absence of interviews for\nCanadian applicants could explain the need for a higher number of supporting documents than, for\ninstance, the U.S., where all applicants are interviewed. Fees requested by Canada to process a\nsingle-entry TRV application are the lowest of all comparison countries. Moreover, Canada offers\ncomparable processing times in the locations reviewed (see Table 3-7). 34\nTable 3-7: Comparison of application processing\nUS UK France Australia Visa Canada\nIn person + In person + VAC + In person + VAC +\nApplication Submission Process Online* VAC\nVAC mail +Online* mail + online*\nInterview 100% If needed If needed If needed If needed\nBiometrics Yes Yes Yes No No\n$75 CAD (single\nFee (excluding VAC fees) $140 CAD $115 CAD $80 CAD $104 CAD\nentry visa)\nProcessing time in working days 14 to 93 days 1 to 10 days 5 to 10 days 5 to 15 days 1 to 21 days **\nSource: CIC Internal Review. * updated information. ** 80% of cases. CIC International region has reviewed all mission requirements, such as forms and supporting\ndocuments requested, with a view to having a more consistent approach for supporting documents\nthroughout the network. CIC’s TRV streamlining exercise in 2011-12 has largely eliminated visa\noffice differences on forms and reduced the number of questions asked. Since January 2011,\napplications are only accessible online and must be completed online to ensure that the 2D barcode\nis created for each application. Applications are no longer mailed to clients, nor are they available\nfor pick up in the missions. It is not known what implications this may have on client perceptions\nof the ease of access to application and on the number of applications received. Approval rates\nTRV approval rates show the extent to which visa officers approve or reject TRV applications,\nwhich could be considered an indicator of facilitation. CIC administrative data indicates that the\nmajority of TRV applications, between 79% and 81%, are approved across all regions for the years\nunder review. By-mission approval rates vary, with a minority having approval rates below 50% (six\nmissions having approval rates below 50% in 2006-2008 and two offices in 2010). Between 17 and\n20 offices (depending on the year) have approval rates of over 90%. Overall, during the last five\nyears, CIC has consistently met the established approval rate target of 80% for visitors. Facilitative approaches\nTo meet its facilitation objective, CIC employs different approaches to facilitate the movement of\nbona fide travellers from visa-required countries. Several facilitative approaches are described\nbelow. The effectiveness of these approaches is difficult to measure due to their relative infancy;\nhowever, some early positive results were observed.",
  "41": "Visa Application Centres (VACs): One of the travel facilitation mechanisms that aim to increase\nconvenience for the client in the visa application experience is the establishment of VACs. VACs\nassist clients with the visa application process by providing computers for self-service, providing\none-on-one application completion service, providing photo and photocopy services, checking\napplications for completion, sending completed applications to the missions via courier; scheduling\ninterviews between applicants and immigration staff at the mission; and receiving sealed visa\ndecisions for distribution to clients. VAC staff also provide services such as answering questions\nfor clients, providing a tracking system so clients can monitor the progress of their application, and\noperating Call Centres and websites to facilitate the application process for clients. Their services are based on cost-recovery established by the service provider (as approved by CIC)\nand their services are optional. The establishment of VACs may yield one or more benefits, which\ninclude:\n35\n Easier access – The ability of VACs to provide more places of service and additional hours of\noperations was noted by several interviewees. This allows clients more opportunity to access a\npoint of service, therefore potentially reducing the time, effort and cost associated with travel\nrequired to submit an application. Canada currently has 60 VACs in 41 countries, almost\ndoubling the points of access available through missions only. By 2014, CIC wants to expand\nthe VAC network to 150 points of services. In an audit of the Mexico VAC performed by CIC\nin July/August 2010, a large majority of the respondents found the VAC location (86%) and the\nhours of operation (93%) to be convenient.  Personal contact – The ability to obtain in-person help with completing and verifying an\napplication is one advantage of the more client-focused environment that VACs can create. Some interview respondents included among the advantages of the VAC the ability to deliver\nface-to-face service and to deliver services in local languages. Although VACs provide a number of facilitation benefits, a number of concerns were raised during\nthe evaluation. These include:\n Increased cost of obtaining a visa - While use of VACs is not mandatory, if a client chooses\nto use the services of a VAC, the VAC fees are an additional cost. However, this may be offset\nby the savings on travel, should such travel to the mission be required to submit the\napplications in person or courier cost to submit the application.  Use of VACs - In Mexico, over 90% of applications are submitted through VACs, which\nindicates it is a popular service; however, a review of some mission websites suggests that it may\nnot be clear to the client if the use of VACs is optional. Therefore it is not clear if VACs are\npopular because of the service they provide or because clients are not sure if they are required\nto use their services.",
  "42": " Applicant privacy – While CIC and clients may be interested in VACs as a travel facilitation\nmechanism, some concerns related to client privacy have been raised. During its operations,\nVACs gather, temporarily, a great deal of client information even though the information that\nthe VAC can collect are limited and the applications and documents are sent daily to the visa\noffice and are not kept at the VAC. Although service agreements stipulate privacy-related\nmitigation strategies, not all had been implemented as visible in the review of the Mexico VAC\n(e.g., VACs use of Google’s email service to contact CIC). As a result of the review, privacy\nprotection processes were strengthened. Privacy and information security concerns were raised\nby a few interviewees. A Privacy Impact Assessment and a Threat and Risk Assessment were\nconducted and the risks were defined as being of medium concern by the Canadian Privacy\nCommissioner. Most of the suggestions for improvement were incorporated in the agreements. This speaks to the importance of undertaking performance and contract reviews to ensure\ncompliance. This will be an integral component of the global contract. In the future, some\nVACs will also be charged with the collection of biometric information, which, while\nconvenient for clients, may increase privacy-related risks. This is currently being reviewed by\nthe Office of the Privacy Commissioner though a Privacy Impact Assessment. Business Facilitation: Another facilitation measure targets business travellers. Facilitation\nmeasures for business travellers have been developed in selected missions abroad and were in use\nfor several years in India and China, and introduced in Mexico following the removal of the visa\nexemption. CIC is now in the process of applying these approaches more widely and, in 2011,\nintroduced broader guidance for such measures. These mechanisms aim to make the process more\n36\nefficient for low-risk cases, while maintaining integrity and improving customer service. Such\ninitiatives include the Business Express Program (BEP), which offers rapid visa processing and\nsimplifies application procedures for employees of pre-qualified businesses and/or priority\nprocessing of business visitor applications. In addition, some missions conduct outreach activities\nwith local business people and business associations in collaboration with the DFAIT Trade\nCommissioner Service in order to answer their questions, review existing procedures, and present\nan overview of visa processing for business visitors. Visa-fee-exempt entry for special events: To facilitate the travel of persons participating in\nspecial events held in Canada, CIC introduced, on a case-by-case basis, an exemption from the visa\nfee. Recent participants to a women’s conference on empowerment, a commonwealth conference,\nand a conference on maternal and child health, have benefitted from this initiative. Transit without Visa (TWOV):21 Another mechanism that facilitates the travel through Canada\nfor foreign nationals of some countries is the exemption from a TRV requirement while travelling\nthrough Canadian airports, allowing them to transit through Canada without having to first obtain\na Canadian temporary resident visa. Multiple-entry/Long-duration visas: CIC has increasingly moved towards the issuance of\nlong-term multiple-entry visas.",
  "43": "The maximum validity period of a multiple-entry visa can be given\nfor the validity of the passport (generally less one month), which may be up to 10 years. This\nreduces the need for the clients to return to visa offices every time they need to travel, thereby\nfacilitating travel to Canada for visitors from visa-required countries. Impact on travel patterns\nTo assess the effect of visa requirements on travel patterns, the evaluation examined the impact of\nthe recent visa changes for the case study countries under review. Table 3-8 presents information\non the annual number of travellers to Canada from each case study country. This information is\npresented separately by status of visa requirement (visa-exempt/ -required), and reports the yearly\nnumber of travellers when each visa condition applied. For the case study countries under review,\nas illustrated, the removal of the visa exemption had a noticeable impact on the number of\ntravellers coming to Canada. Specifically, the number of Mexican travellers to Canada dropped\nconsiderably since the removal of the visa exemption in 2009, although it is not clear to what extent\nlarger global events (such as the financial crisis and ensuing recession) played a role in the\nmagnitude of this decrease. In the case of the Czech Republic, the table also shows a noticeable\ndecrease in the number of travellers since the removal of the visa exemption. The impact of granting a visa exemption is less pronounced; however, the data show some increase\nin travel after granting a visa exemption. For example, the number of travellers from Poland and\nthe Czech Republic increased greatly in the years in which nationals of these countries could travel\nto Canada without first obtaining a visa. While it is clear that visa requirement changes have an\nimpact on travel patterns, it is difficult to assess the extent to which bona fide travellers are affected. In particular, when a visa exemption is granted, it is difficult to determine whether the increase in\ntravel to Canada is the result of non-bona fide travellers (unfounded asylum seekers, those who\nwould otherwise be found inadmissible); similarly, the same can be attributed to decreases in travel\ndue to the removal of a visa exemption (ineligible/inadmissible people are screened out or are\ndeterred from applying). However, the magnitude of this is difficult to estimate, especially in\n21 cicintranet/CICExplore/english/guides/bulletins/2011/297-eng.aspx\n37\nconjunction with the many other factors that either hinder or encourage travel to Canada (i.e.,\neconomic conditions, geographic location, ease of application process, etc.).

Many interviewees confirmed that when a visa exemption is removed, there is a negative impact on\nthe travel of bona fide visitors to Canada. A visa requirement can be an irritant and have a\npsychological effect on bona fide travel to Canada, suggesting that in certain cultures and countries\nnot granting a visa exemption could be a sign of Canada being a ‘closed’ country, thus deterring\ntravel by its citizens. Some interviewees noted that while there is an initial negative impact on travel when visa\nexemption is removed, their perception is that this impact is only short-term. Because visas are\ncommon across the world and the fees are competitive in Canada, travellers become accustomed to\nthe requirement and travel patterns should return to pre-imposition levels. 3.4.4. Balancing facilitation with integrity\nTo assess the balance between the facilitation and system integrity objectives, the evaluation\nfocused on the perceptions of key informants. Respondents were asked to comment on whether\nCIC’s visitor visa policy was successful in meeting its overall objective: balancing the protection of\nthe integrity of Canada’s immigration and asylum system with the facilitation of temporary resident\ntravel. Finding: CIC’s visitor visa policy, supported by other tools with similar objectives, is largely\nperceived to have successfully achieved a balance between protecting the integrity of its\nimmigration and asylum system and the facilitation of bona-fide travel to Canada. In addition, the\nvisa policy is dynamic and has the ability to allow CIC to react to contextual changes. The majority of respondents felt that CIC’s visa policy has achieved a balance between the\nfacilitation and protection objectives. A few commented that the balance has been achieved to a\nlarge degree with a slight emphasis on protection, as evidenced by the recent visa imposition\n38\ndecisions. Only a minority of interviewees considered the policy to be more facilitative than the\ncontext requires, and suggested that visa policy may be influenced by stakeholders interested in\npromoting economic benefits to Canada. Respondents who felt that CIC has achieved the necessary balance, frequently cited some of the\nnew tools and program as important components of this balance. Many interviewees commented that while visa policy is a crude, blanket approach intended to\nprotect Canadians, there are other tools, policies and programs that CIC and OGDs offer that help\nachieve/refine this balance.",
  "45": "As previously noted, initiatives that help facilitate travel include:\nprograms that facilitate travel for business people, workers, and certain groups travelling with tour\ncompanies; and Visa Application Centres (VACs). Other initiatives, such as biometrics, attempt to\nincrease security and protect Canadian borders. Overall, interviewees suggested that the balance between security and facilitation shifts depending\non the political climate or international events (e.g., September 11, 2001) and visa policy decisions\nshould have the ability to address those emerging risks and opportunities. Most respondents agreed\nthe visa policy is dynamic and has the ability to allow CIC to react to contextual changes. 3.4.5. Other impacts related to visa requirement changes\nA number of additional impact of visa changes identified during the evaluation on bilateral\nrelations, partners, and the tourism industry are examined in this section. Finding: The removal of visa exemptions affects Canada’s bilateral relations with countries\nimpacted by the change. Furthermore, the introduction or removal of visitor visa requirements can\nimpact CIC partners’ operations and political mandates. Impact on bilateral relations with other countries\nMany interviewees acknowledged the fact that Canada’s visa policy may have an impact on bilateral\nrelations. However, this impact is very difficult to anticipate because it depends on many external\nfactors, such as how the impacted country interprets the change. Many interviewees stated that the\nvisa change processes, including the country visit, aim to address in advance any potential bilateral\nor multilateral issues with the impacted countries. Nevertheless, two of the recent cases may have had a negative effect on bilateral relations. The\nremoval of the visa exemption for nationals of the Czech Republic affected Canada’s bilateral\nrelations with that country in three ways: the Czech government retaliated by imposing a visa\nrequirement on Canadians travelling to the Czech Republic on diplomatic and official passports; it\nrecalled its Ambassador to Canada; and it continues to warn that the visa requirement may affect\nthe Czech Republic’s position on bilateral or multilateral initiatives (such as the Canada-EU\nComprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement). The Czech Republic case is also a key source of\nstrain between Canada and the European Union due to the fact that Canada does not adhere to the\nEuropean Union’s policy of reciprocity. This may also prove an irritant with Romania and Bulgaria,\nboth EU states still requiring Canadian TRVs who may use the trade negotiations and ratification\nissues as possible leverage in discussions on the continuation of the Canadian visa requirement. In the case of Mexico, interviewees noted that the removal of the visa exemption created negative\nfeelings towards Canada. During many bilateral or trilateral meetings with Mexican government\n39\nrepresentatives, the topic of the visa requirement was broached. In addition, the Government of\nMexico introduced a visa for Canadian diplomatic personnel. Impact on OGD partners\nThe majority of interviewees indicated that some of CIC’s immigration and enforcement partners\n(i.e., CBSA, DFAIT, RCMP, IRB, P/Ts) are impacted by CIC’s visitor visa policy and associated\nvisa changes.",
  "46": "The magnitude of this impact depends on the role of the department and may depend\non what country is affected by the decision. The following notes several impacts on certain\npartners:\n CBSA: Interviewees noted that CBSA’s ability to meet its protection mandate may be affected,\nespecially when a visa exemption is granted and results in an increased number of asylum claims\nat the border and eventual need to remove unsuccessful claimants or visitors that overstay. Conversely, visa re-imposition supports the CBSA mandate to large degree as it reduces those\nactivities related to large numbers of asylum claims at the border from a particular country.  DFAIT: Many interviewees suggested that DFAIT is affected in its ability to meet its\nfacilitation mandate when a visa exemption is removed because it receives many complaints\nfrom business and government officials. DFAIT’s role in promoting trade is also affected by a\nchange in visa requirements, as well as by its role as a government representative in the\ninternational arena. This is visible in the impact on dealings with the European Union with\nregards to the change in visa requirements for nationals of the Czech Republic.  RCMP: A few interviewees noted that the RCMP is likely to have some possible resource\nimplications if more criminality screenings are required.  IRB: To the extent that changing a visa requirement has an impact on the number of refugee\nclaims, it will also have an impact on the workload of the IRB; either increasing in refugee\nclaims as a result of a visa lifting or decrease in case visa exemption is removed.  P/Ts: Provinces are affected by the number of asylum claimants in terms of the costs\nassociated with the provision of social services. On the other hand, provincial tourism is also\naffected with the potential decline in travellers from certain countries (e.g. ; Mexican tourists to\nBritish Columbia ski resorts). Finding: There is a potential negative impact on the Canadian tourism industry when a visa\nexemption is removed, as it is expected to result in a decrease in the number of travellers from the\naffected country. Conversely, when a visa exemption is granted, it should have a positive impact\non tourism. The available evidence supports these assumptions, although data on the magnitude of\nthe impact is mixed. Impact on Canadian tourism industry\nAs noted previously, re-imposing a visa requirement on a country has an impact on travel patterns\nto Canada. The expectation is that the removal of a visa exemption will decrease the number of\ntravellers to Canada, thereby decreasing tourism revenue, and the reverse is expected when a visa\nexemption is granted. Some key informants believe that there was an impact on the Canadian\ntourism industry due to the potential decrease in travellers from countries following the recent\nchanges to visa requirements. However, they also believed that any potential impact can only be\nconsidered on a case-by-case basis.",
  "47": "Partners who represent the tourism industry identified the\n40\npotential risks, which include decreased revenues and employment. An analysis of the potential\nimpact of the Mexico visa requirement on the Canadian tourism industry, provided by Statistics\nCanada, suggests that for the first two years since the change in visa requirements, the Canadian\ntourism industry potentially lost approximately $340 million dollars in tourism revenue.22 This must\nbe compared with the cost of the processing of unfounded refugee claims for the two countries (as\npresented later in the Section on Efficiency and Economy). Analysis of the Taiwan tourism data\nfrom the Canadian Tourism Commission shows that the gain in the Taiwanese tourists brought an\nadditional $5 million into the Canadian economy (vis-à-vis $33 million predicted in the RIAS). The\ninformation on Poland, another case study country where a visa exemption was introduced, shows\nsome increase in travel but the impact cannot be estimated due to lack of data. 3.5. Efficiency, economy and alternatives\nA review of costs associated with the Visitor Visa Program, potential alternatives and\nsupplementary approaches, as well as a literature review of tools used by peer countries is contained\nwithin the following section. 3.5.1. Resource utilization\nThis section briefly reviews Program cost, cost per visa as well as resource saving associated with\nintroduction of visa. Finding: Although the evaluation framework did not include a detailed analysis of program costs,\navailable data suggests that there are several financial resource implications associated with TRVs. Furthermore, according to internal financial data, the costs of processing a visa are higher than the\nrevenue generated from TRV fees. CIC Program cost\nThe total costs associated with the CIC Visitor Visa Program (processing, policy and management,\nand corporate support services) are presented in Table 3-9. Using data from CIC’s Cost\nManagement Model (CMM)23, these costs were estimated at $68M in 2007/08 and $87.5M in\n2009/10. A part of the cost of the Program is CIC’s corporate services, allocated as a percentage of\nthe overall CIC expenditures across all CIC programs. With growth in the overall CIC budget the\ncost appears to grow significantly between the two years. A review of the direct visa processing cost\nassociated with CIC, LES and CBSA integration officers in the missions shows that around\n$23-24M (33% of the total for 2007/08 and 27% of the total for 2009/10) was allocated to\nprocessing visas overseas (including screening, processing applications, conducting anti-fraud\nactivities, and providing outreach to the public). This amount has not changed significantly\nbetween the two years for which data is available. 22 www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/arts38a-eng.htm\n23 CMM combines visa processing efforts estimates from CIC units and the TRV volumetrics obtained from\noperational systems to establish the total costs related to the processing of Visitor Visas. Visitor Visas processing costs\nshown in the table above include operational processing, program management and policy and corporate services. CMM allocates the costs of program management and policy and corporate services based on weighted costs\npercentage attributed to the TRV program.",
  "48": "41\nTable 3-9: TRP program cost\n2007-08 2009-10\nCIC Visitor Visas Processing CIC $10,253,749 $10,553,399\nCBSA - Integration Officers $416,227 $634,348\nLocally Engaged Staff $11,881,769 $13,182,410\nPartial Costs for CIC Visitor Visa processing $22,551,746 $24,370,157\nProgram and Policy Support $22,649,653 $31,239,956\nCorporate Support $22,868,037 $31,925,107\nTotal Program Costs* $68,069,435 $87,535,219\nSource: CIC Cost Management Model - 2007-08 and 2009-10 Strategic outcomes cubes. Cost per visa\nThe resources presented above represent CIC costs associated with processing TRVs, including\nCIC, LES and Integrity Officers from CBSA whose salaries are covered by CIC. Table 3-10 (below)\nuses the latest available TRV cost calculations from CIC’s Finance Branch, which includes costs\nborne by other government departments (DFAIT, Department of Justice, additional CBSA\nfunctions, RCMP, etc.). It shows that the revenues and costs associated with processing temporary\nresident visas for visitors remained fairly stable over the years (2001/02-2007/08). Table 3-10 also\nshows that the revenues and costs associated with processing temporary resident visas for visitors\nwere lower than the revenues and costs associated with processing temporary workers and\nstudents. The table also indicates that full cost recovery of TRV processing was not achieved. This\nmeans that, for the period under review, the cost of producing a visa was higher than the revenue\ngenerated through processing fees. Furthermore, the literature review suggests that all reviewed\ncountries have had difficulty fully recovering the cost of processing visitor visas through fees. While raising application fees to ensure cost recovery may be an option, it may also result in\ndiminishing tourism and trade.

Information\nfrom RCMP is missing for some years. 42\nTRV processing activities\nCIC estimates the level of effort involved in processing applications. However, due to the structure\nof the system, which relies on extrapolation based on volume, it is difficult to precisely define how\nthe time allocated to processing TRVs is actually spent on the various activities, such as criminality\nscreening. While volume-based estimates are available, CIC has no precise information to assess\nthe actual resource allocation to the particular task. In addition, given the lack of targets for each\nactivity, it is not possible to make any judgement on the appropriateness of resource allocation to\ntasks, especially those related to processes related to security screening (anti-fraud, criminality\nscreening, etc.). Financial resources\nThere are financial resource implications when a visa requirement change is made.",
  "49": "When a visa\nexemption is removed, CIC may need to open a visa office in the affected country or close an office\nwhen a visa exemption is granted. Interviewees commented that CIC foregoes revenue (to the\nConsolidated Revenue Fund) when it grants a visa exemption, which may pose a significant\nresource pressure for CIC when granting visa exemptions, yet this is not a consideration in\nproviding the recommendations. Furthermore, resources are allocated to support visa changes on\ncase-by-case basis. When a visa exemption is removed, CIC and its partners must seek resources to\nsupport the implementation of the change. In some cases, they must find the resources within their\nexisting allocations; in the case of significant change, such as Mexico, resources may be allocated\nthrough separate funding request. Asylum claim costs\nThe cost of asylum claims is significant in both federal and provincial governments. The federal\ncosts are incurred through operational processing and the provision of interim federal health\nbenefits to asylum claimants and their families in Canada. The provincial costs are incurred through\nthe provision of legal aid, social assistance, and education. Under the current in Canada asylum\nsystem, the total cost per claimant is estimated by CIC at:\n $16,142 for positive claimants ($5,992 federal and $10,151 provincial)\n $48,285 for negative claimants ($16,593 federal and $31,693 provincial) based on estimated\ntime of 50 months for negative claims. The costs associated with processing the number of negative and abandoned claims from Mexico\nin 2009 was estimated24 at $304M and $68M for Czech Republic. In 2010, given the decrease in the\nnumber of claims received, these cost were estimated at $44M for Mexico and $1.2M for the Czech\nRepublic, representing a net savings of $326M. Not taking into account other potential costs of\nremoving the visa exemption granted to nationals of Mexico or the Czech Republic (e.g., loss of\ntourism), both the federal government and the provinces benefitted from the savings associated\nwith a decrease in the number of unfounded refugee claims in Canada. 24 The cost of processing positive cases is not included in these estimates. The cost was calculated using the average\nnumber of years claimants remain in the country while their claim is in process. The cost associated with\nabandoned/withdrawn claims was calculated using half of the cost for negative cases. 43\n3.5.2. Alternatives\nWhen assessing the alternatives to the Visitor Visa Program the evaluation focused on 3 different\nperspectives:\n Alternative to the evidence-based approach represented by the visa policy framework;\n Alternatives to visitor visa as a tool;\n Alternatives to addressing similar objectives – protecting integrity of the immigration and\nasylum system. Finding: There are several potential alternatives to CIC’s approach to TRVs. While they are unlikely\nto better meet CIC’s facilitation and integrity objectives at the present time, some could be\neffectively used to supplement existing frameworks, tools and indicators, thereby creating a more\nencompassing system.",
  "50": "Alternatives to the visa policy framework\nThere are two main policymaking alternatives that could be used rather than the evidence-based\ndecision making approach currently employed by Canada: the reciprocity approach and the\nperimeter approach. In addition, instead of using a policy framework, decisions could be rooted in\nlegislation. Reciprocity: Reciprocity is a principle that governs visa policymaking and in which two countries\nexchange the privileges of visa-free travel with one another. Basing policymaking on reciprocity\ncould reduce the current level of data collection and evidence gathering, as a decision would rely on\nbilateral agreements\nAs an example, Canada is under some pressure from the EU to extend visa-free travel to its\nmember countries in a reciprocal approach. When new member countries are admitted to the EU\n(more specifically, to the Schengen area), they extend visa-free travel to Canadians; in exchange, the\nEU would like to see visa-free travel in Canada for the new members. While Canada has lifted visa\nrequirements for citizens of Estonia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic (subsequently\nreintroduced) and Lithuania, it was done based on the current process, not on reciprocity. Currently, Canada has a variety of arrangements with various Schengen area countries as some still\nrequire a TRV to travel to Canada and some travel visa-free. In 2011, citizens of Hungary, who do\nnot need a visa, represented the highest source of asylum claims made in Canada (Technical\nAppendix). Therefore, while the reciprocity approach could contribute to achieving the facilitation objective\nand would be beneficial to bilateral relationships, it could have negative implications on the\nintegrity of the immigration and asylum systems. Canada is considered one of the most risk-free\ncountries in the world, and the use of reciprocity for countries that grant Canada visa-free travel\nmay expose Canada to unnecessary risks. Perimeter: A second potential approach to defining a country’s visitor visa policy is to align the\npolicy of several countries to create a perimeter, governed by similar rules of entry for all countries\nwithin the area. The goal of such an approach is to create a common security area, while at the same\ntime, facilitating free mobility between members. The Schengen Area in Europe is the most\nrecognized example of such an approach. This approach is effective in facilitating movement\nbetween member countries and providing all countries within the perimeter area with an integrated\n44\napproach to achieve joint security objectives. On the other hand, the perimeter approach requires\nmember countries to give up some degree of independent control over decisions regarding its\nborders. Access to a country has been one of the most guarded rights associated with state\nsovereignty; the movement toward integration of members may be a challenge and may be resisted\nby the citizens of the member countries. Among Canadians, 75% are in favour of shared\nintelligence gathering between Canada and the United States, and 23% strongly support this idea.",
  "51": "However, over two-thirds (68%) of these same respondents believe that Canada will cede too much\npower to the United States over decisions related to immigration, privacy and security.25 Challenges\nin developing such an approach include: creating common systems, processes, and information\nsharing agreements; the high reliance on IT; and the exchange of information between various\njurisdictions and systems is a concern, in terms of use of personal information and privacy issues. On December 7, 2011, Canada and the US announced an Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic\nCompetitiveness focusing on multiple joint border-related initiatives to achieve a vision built upon a\nperimeter approach to security and economic competitiveness.26 Many of the challenges will be\naddressed in cooperation agreements, such as an information-sharing agreement, through the\nintroduction of enhanced screening systems (discussed in next section) and through\ninteroperability of IT systems and databases. While the Action Plan aims to align some processes, it\ndoes not call for the alignment of visa exempt countries. Thus, the current evidence-based\napproach will still inform any future Canadian visa policy decisions. Legislated approach: The US uses a legislative approach for introducing countries to their Visa\nWaiver Program, under which each country admitted must be reviewed on a two-year schedule. This approach, while providing structure and formality, was perceived by interviewees as less\nflexible than the current needs-based approach. It would require additional resources and was not\nviewed as contributing to the integrity of the visa policy nor would it improve facilitation of travel. All three of the above policy approaches could potentially be used by Canada; however, the review\nof their strengths and constraints suggest that none would replace the evidence-based approach\ncurrently used to achieve a balance between facilitation and integrity objectives. Therefore, the\nevidence-based approach currently employed by Canada appears to be the best way for Canada to\nmeet the stated objectives in a flexible and effective manner. Alternative to the TRV tool\nIn terms of the TRV itself, the main method for granting permission to enter being used currently\nby several of Canada’s peer countries is the electronic travel authorization tool. Electronic travel authorization programs (including the Australian eTA/eVisitor and US\nESTA approaches): An electronic travel authorization requires a potential traveller to complete\nan electronic online application form. The information is processed through an automatic risk\nscreening system which determines whether the individual can travel (positive assessment), or\nrequires an in-person assessment (negative). These programs have been introduced by peer\ncountries such as Australia and the U.S., but have not yet been implemented by Canada.27 In these\n25 Potential Elements of Perimeter Security Deal Garners Strong Support and Canadians have Reservations about\nAspects of Perimeter Security Deal. www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/research/scan/march2011/index.asp\n26 actionplan.gc.ca/eng/feature.asp?pageId=337\n27 Discussion regarding the development of a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) program is currently\nunderway.",
  "52": "In the Action Plan on Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness, Canada committed to implementing an\nenhanced approach to identifying and interdicting inadmissible persons at the perimeter, including establishing an eTA\n45\ncountries, the travel authorization is used as ‘limited’ screening tool for low-risk countries which\neither have the legal status of a visa (as in the case of Australia), or is used to affirm eligibility to\ntravel under visa-exempt status (as in the case of the U.S.). In principle, the electronic travel\nauthorization tool addresses dual objectives: facilitation of travel, by enabling residents of certain\ncountries to go through a less demanding process of obtaining a travel authorization; and\nprotection, by enabling the screening of all travelers to some degree. Strengths:\n Efficiency and program integrity – Some anecdotal evidence from the literature review\nsuggests that the introduction of an electronic system reduced the workload in visa offices in\nAustralia, as some of applicants are now processed through electronic means. This enables\nofficers to process visitor visa applications from clients who are required to complete a\ntraditional visa application more quickly and/or devote more attention to complex\napplications. Evidence also suggests that processing at the POE is more efficient as a greater\nnumber of applicants would be ‘known’ at the time of entry as their data will be available\nthrough an electronic record, and could therefore be processed more quickly upon entry.  Ease of application process – Some evidence from the literature review suggests that these\nprograms contribute to the facilitation of travel as the client benefits from ability to do the\nprocess on-line.  Less of a bilateral irritant – Evidence suggests that this requirement resulted in a lower level\nof criticism from affected countries in Europe compared to the introduction of a visa\nrequirement. The eTA could be used to complement granting visa exemptions in situations\nwhere some potential risks may exist, yet facilitation would be beneficial for other reasons. As\nthe Australian experience shows, introduction of such an approach was received favourably by\ncountries granted an exemption from the traditional visa process.  Increased coverage - In the Canadian context, an electronic travel authorization could\naddress potential screening gaps that exist for visa exempt countries, specifically, individuals\nfrom these countries that pose a risk to Canada. This has the benefit of preventing some\ninadmissible travellers from arriving in Canada, where detention, removal costs and social costs\ncould be incurred. The literature review was not able to determine whether the Australia ETA\nhas been successful in actually reducing these risks. Challenges:\n Information privacy concerns – Evidence from the literature review suggests that there is\nnot a full understanding or discussion (with exception of the EU) of the privacy issues with the\nmove to electronic system of visa provision; however, issues such as identity theft and function\nexpansion have been raised as concerns. It was also mentioned that this may increase with the\ncollection of biometric information in the future.",
  "53": " Quality of decision – The decision generated by the electronic system will only be as strong as\nthe data entered in the systems, especially as it relates to information collected and provided by\nother countries. Furthermore, reliance on electronic decision-making, as opposed to\nface-to-face and paper assessment, reduces the human aspect of decision-making (e.g. ;\nsystem, to improve screening of all visa-exempt foreign nationals. This initiative will mirror measures taken in the US\nthrough its Electronic System for Travel Authorization system. 46\nsuspicions about an applications intentions and demeanour based on contact with the file or in\nperson). In addition, in the Canadian context, the decision to grant a visitor visa is delegated to\nMinister and its representatives and, at this point, does not include an electronic means of\ndecision rendering.  Reliance on IT systems – With shift to electronic service provision, IT security and\ninteroperability have become continuing and grown concern due to the complexity/cost of\nimplementation (reliance on costly external experts/consultants) and the continued need for\ninformation sharing across jurisdictions.  Additional requirement – If the eTA is introduced on countries that are currently visa\nexempt, it may be perceived as an imposition on travellers. This was not the case in Australia,\nwhich has a universal visa requirement. In such cases, the eTA appears to be more of a\nfacilitation mechanism. However if the eTA is introduced for countries that are currently visa\nexempt, the eTA operates as an additional screening mechanism rather than facilitation tool. Overall, given the limited information to date on the effectiveness of the eTA, it is unclear whether\nits introduction in Canada would improve travel for those countries that are currently visa-free,\nalthough it would provide an additional screening mechanism for those countries. It could also\nfacilitate travel from some lower-risk countries that currently require a visa if it was used as an\nalternative. Evidence from the Australian and US program has shown that these programs are an\neffective tool for identifying some inadmissible travellers and those using lost/stolen/fraudulent\ntravel documents. As the introduction of an eTA system is not expected to take place over the next\n2-3 years, in the near future, the traditional visitor visa will remain the primary tool for managed\nmigration for the immediate future. Alternatives to protecting the integrity of the immigration system\nThe Visitor Visa Program is intended to protect the integrity of the immigration system. In\ninterviews biometrics and exit controls were the most frequently mentioned alternatives to\nachieving this objective.  Biometrics: The use of biometrics is seen by many countries as a complementary tool for\nmanagement of the temporary movement of migrants. It has dual objectives: the facilitation of\ntravel for bona fide travellers by enabling them to be screened faster at the POEs and increased\nprecision in identifying those that may pose a risk to Canada.",
  "54": "There are, however, implications\nin terms of: client privacy, especially if biometrics collection is done by commercial service\nproviders such as VACs; IT reliance; system interoperability; and the quality of data associated\nwith its implementation.28\n Exit Controls: Some interviewees noted that implementing an exit control system would be\none way of measuring how effective Canada is managing temporary travel. Exit controls would\nenable Canada to create a record of when a temporary resident leaves Canada, which would\nprovide more up-to-date information on irregular migration trends (overstays, etc.). Exit\ncontrols could be an effective measurement/monitoring tool and provide information on\noverstays as a good indicator of non-compliance. In the Action Plan on Perimeter Security and\nEconomic Competitiveness, Canada and the United States committed to developing a system, by\n28 With the passage of the Protecting Canada’s Immigration System Act on June 29, 2012, the Government of Canada will be\nable to require biometric information from certain applicants starting in 2013 as part of the visitor visa, study, and work\npermit application process. However, given the costs, biometrics will only be implemented for select countries. 47\nJune 30, 2014, to exchange biographical information on the entry of travellers, at the common\nland border, including citizens, permanent residents and third-country nationals, such that a\nrecord of entry into one country could be considered as a record of an exit from the other. Canada also committed to developing a system to establish exit for air travel, similar to that in\nthe United States, under which airlines will be required to submit their passenger manifest\ninformation on outbound international flights. Alternatives to protecting the integrity of the asylum system\nThe Visitor Visa Program has as an objective to protect the integrity of the asylum system. The\nfollowing examines alternatives in achieving this objective:\n Safe Third Country Agreement: Safe Third Country agreements require people making\nasylum claims to do so in the first safe country they arrive to. This option would reduce the\nnumber of asylum claims for those who are transiting through other countries but would not\naddress the number of claimants coming directly from their country of origin; therefore, it\nwould be only partially effective in lowering number of asylum claims made in Canada.  Reform of Canada’s asylum system: As stated by the Auditor General of Canada in its 2003\nreport, delays in rendering final decisions on asylum claims can leave the system open to abuse. Long processing times encourage potential unfounded asylum claimants to make claims\nknowing that they will be able to live and work in Canada for many years. To address this\nweakness, the Government has initiated a broad reform of Canada’s asylum system aiming to\nshortening the time it takes to process claims.29 If the claims are processed more quickly, the\npotential for abuse should diminish. However, as the full implementation of reforms to the\nasylum system is yet to be completed, its potential effectiveness in improving the integrity of\nthe asylum system is not yet known.",
  "55": "With time, however, it is presumed that this reform will\naddress some of the issues related to the integrity of the system.  Safe Country of Origin: One of the strategies under the reform of Canada’s asylum system\nthat could also be considered independently is the designation of certain countries as “Safe\nCountry of Origin”. Nationals from those countries would be able to make asylum claims, but\nthey would be processed in an expedited manner. As it has not yet been fully implemented, it is\ndifficult to determine how effective this approach would be in improving the integrity of the\nasylum system. While all the above approaches could be effective in addressing asylum system integrity, their\neffectiveness cannot currently be measured, given the changes underway in the asylum system. A review of all the above mechanisms suggest that while alternatives to policymaking,\nimplementation and protecting system integrity exist, the visitor visa remains the most effective\ntool to manage migration at the current time and for the near future. The evidence-based approach\nprovides for targeted and flexible changes, and while the ETA is considered the most likely\npotential alternative for many years to come it will complement the visitor visa approach. In\naddition, in terms of approaches to address system integrity, all of these could, theoretically, play a\nrole in addressing system integrity; they will all take time to be fully implemented. Implementing an\n29 Bill C-11, the Balanced Refugee Reform Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2010, and Bill C-31, the Protecting\nCanada’s Immigration System Act, which received Royal Assent on June 29, 2012, were introduced to protect and improve\nCanada’s immigration system. Among several measures are changes to accelerate the processing of asylum claims and\nthe introduction of Designated Countries of Origin. 48\nexit control system would be one way of improving and measuring how effective Canada manages\nits temporary travel. Currently, most countries have a mix of migration control tools that include\nvisas, eTA tool as a visa alternative for selected lower-risk countries and general country-level\nexemptions. As the literature review points out, the immediate future is likely to involve a hybrid\nsystem rooted in country-level exemptions (determined at the national or, in the European case, regional level)\ncomplemented by selective exemption from full applications approaches. Decisions to adopt one or more of\nthese tools are predicated upon an assessment of their risks and benefits by each country. 49\n4. Conclusions and recommendations\nRelevance/alternatives\nThe visitor visa is a relevant tool as it addresses the need to manage the movement of temporary\nresidents. It remains widely used by peer countries and, in the majority of cases, Canada’s visa\nexemption list aligns with its peers. This creates an environment where Canada facilitates travel,\nwhile preventing the entry of travellers that could pose risks to the integrity of the immigration and\nasylum system, and the safety and health of Canadians.",
  "56": "While potential alternatives to Canada’s visitor visa exist, such as an electronic travel authorization\n(eTA) system, the visitor visa will remain the most effective tool to manage migration until other\ntools are further investigated / implemented and their effectiveness is assessed. Recommendation #1: Canada should continue using the visitor visa as a tool to manage migration,\nwhile at the same time, investigate the feasibility of introducing supplementary tools to better meet its objectives\n(protection and facilitation). In doing so, CIC should take into account the benefits, risks and resource needs\nassociated with implementing each option. Performance\nPolicy\nMonitoring and evidence from country reviews are used, as required, to support visa policy\nrecommendations and the regulatory process. However, the visitor visa program, as currently\ndesigned, focuses on CIC’s own objectives and does not take a whole-of-government approach. While the policy process seeks input of relevant other government departments, there is a need to\nimprove their involvement and participation in analysis and decision-making processes. Recommendation #2: CIC should assess, with its federal government partners, the strengths and\nweaknesses of the current partner engagement strategy in visa policy development, to address their needs and\nconcerns and gauge the feasibility of broadening the considerations during the visa review process, towards an\nincreased whole-of-government approach. Processing\nThe evaluation presented recent CIC efforts to introduce or expand various facilitative\nmechanisms, such as VACs, multiple entry visas, long-term visas, and the business express\nprogram, in order to streamline the processing of applications. Those initiatives have the purpose\nof creating streamlined processes to make it easier for clients to visit Canada and reduce resource\nutilization at CIC. As these are fairly new initiatives, the evaluation did not assess their effectiveness\nat this time. In addition, the evaluation reviewed the role of the VAC in supporting processing in Mexico,\nidentified some benefits but also the importance of undertaking performance and contract reviews\nto ensure compliance. With expansion of the VAC network in the world, CIC is relying increasingly\non a variety of third-party organizations to support the TRV process. The expansion of VAC to a\nglobal network is a new initiative and creates new opportunities and possible challenges. 50\nWith continued expansion of the VAC network, CIC is increasingly relying on a variety of\nthird-party organizations to support the TRV process. The expansion of VAC to a global network\nis a new initiative and creates new opportunities and possible challenges. Recommendation #3: CIC should develop strategy and assessment tools to measure the impact of the\nvarious facilitative mechanisms, in terms of their objectives and effectiveness in managing processing demands. This should also include an assessment of the VAC network and its effectiveness in assisting the modernizing\nof CIC operations. Integrity of the immigration and asylum systems\nThe visitor visa is an effective tool that helps protect the integrity of CIC’s immigration and asylum\nsystem by reducing irregular migration (primarily unfounded refugee claims), and potentially\nplaying a deterrence role.",
  "57": "Measuring the overall impact of the visa on irregular migration is\nchallenging due to lack of data on certain indicators (i.e. overstays, illegally working in Canada, etc.). Recommendation #4: CIC should explore other, more effective methods of collecting data on irregular\nmigration, such as overstays, to better inform policy-makers about the success of the program in achieving its\nimmigration and asylum system integrity objectives. 51\n\nAppendix A: Evaluation matrix\nEvaluation Issues Indicator Methodology\nRelevance\n1.

Canada — Visa & permit eligibility reference (Work permits, Study permits, Visitor)\n\nOVERVIEW\nSummarizes core Canadian program rules: employer-driven work permits (LMIA where required), study permits (DLIs, proof of funds), visitor rules. Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options. It is written to be unambiguous and suitable for a retrieval-augmented pipeline (RAG). All factual claims that are likely to change (amounts, named programs) are cited to the official Government of Canada pages.

A **positive LMIA** confirms that no Canadian worker is available for the job and that hiring a foreign worker will have a neutral or positive effect on the labour market. IRCC then issues a work permit using the LMIA and the job offer. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\n\n- Employer responsibilities: advertising the job, applying for LMIA, paying required fees, meeting recruitment requirements for LMIA (where applicable). See ESDC guidance on which type of LMIA to submit. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}\n\nB) LMIA-exempt work permits\n- Some work permits are LMIA-exempt under international agreements, intra-company transfers (L-1 equivalent via Canadian rules), or other IRCC-specified exemptions. Confirm exemption details on IRCC pages. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}\n\nC) Open work permits\n- Open work permits let a person work for most employers without a specific job offer.

Electronic Travel Authorization Temporary Resident Visa\nApplies to 54 visa-exempt countries* Applies to majority of countries\n- Light-touch screening - Comprehensive screening\n- Apply online - Supporting documents required (passport,\n- Most applications automatically approved bank statements)\nin minutes - Requires biometrics\n- Screens for immigration history - Screens for traveler intent\n- Cost: $7 - Approved in weeks\n- Cost: $185 ($100 temporary resident visa\n+ $85 biometrics fee)\nUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, and\nChina, India, and Brazil are the top visa-\nMexico are the top source countries for\nrequired source countries. electronic travel authorizations. 3\n*United States citizens and certain other small groups are exempt from the electronic travel authorization requirement. Visa and\nMaking Visa Policy Decisions\nVisitor Policy\nCanada’s Visa Policy Framework\n- Decisions regarding countries who do or do not need a temporary resident visa\nare guided by Canada’s Visa Policy Framework, which assesses over 40\ncriteria (e.g., migration trends, social and economic factors, border control). - Visa policy decisions seek to balance the benefits of facilitated travel, including\ntrade and tourism benefits, with risks to the safety and security of Canadians. Visa policy decisions require careful management\n- A visa exemption communicates a message of trust and partnership; an\nimposition is perceived as damaging to a country’s global standing. - These decisions have measurable impacts on trade, investment, and\ncooperation with other countries regarding Canada’s priorities on the\ninternational stage. 4\nVisa and\nCurrent Status\nVisitor Policy\nMore and more people want to visit Canada\n- Canada attracts more visitors each year, with volumes expected to grow\nby 8-10% annually for the foreseeable future. Other temporary entry\ncategories (e.g., international students, foreign workers) are also seeing\nsignificant growth. - This presents an important opportunity for Canada as international\ntourism currently generates approximately $22.1B each year.

This risk is determined by nationality. - The visa’s broad, nationality-based approach remains\nan effective screening tool for higher-risk visitors, but\nbalancing foreign policy, economic, and security\nconsiderations is challenging. - Canada is attracting more visitors each year.

  "77": "Express Entry System\nTechnical Briefing\n- Overview of Express Entry system\n– How it works\n– Comprehensive Ranking System\n– Invitation to Apply\n– Provincial Nominee Program\n2\nBackground\nAs of January 1st, 2015, skilled foreign workers have access to\nExpress Entry – a new electronic application management\nsystem – which applies to Canada’s key economic immigration\nprograms:\n– Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP);\n– Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP);\n– Canadian Experience Class (CEC); and,\n– A portion of the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Express Entry does not change or replace the requirements of these\nimmigration programs. 3\nExpress Entry: Changes how Canada selects skilled immigrants\nMoving from the old system… to Express Entry\n- First applicant in, first to be processed - CIC selects candidates that are most likely to\nsucceed in Canada, rather than the first in line\n- Difficult to navigate the immigration\nsystem due to multiple players - Express Entry candidates with a valid job offer or\nP/T nomination will quickly be invited to apply (ITA)\n- Recruitment of global talent at employer\nfor permanent residence\ntime and expense\n- Later in 2015 (exact date TBC), the new Job Bank\n- Average of 12-14 months to process an\nwill connect Canadian employers with a pool of\napplication\nskilled foreign national candidates if they can’t find\nCanadians or permanent residents to do the job\n- Express Entry candidates will benefit from\nprocessing times of six months or less*. *In 80% of cases from receipt of complete application for\n4\npermanent residence to final decision. The New Two-Step Application Process: Candidate\n5\nStep 1: Express Entry Profile\n- Candidates can promote themselves:\n- They are encouraged to signal their presence in the\nExpress Entry pool to recruiters, on private sector job\nboards, participate in job fairs, contact Canadian\nemployers directly, etc. - Registration with Job Bank is required unless a\ncandidate has a valid job offer or PT nomination\n6\nExpress Entry Pool\n- All candidates in the Express Entry pool are assigned a score according\nto their skills, education and experience\n- Candidates profiles can remain in the pool for up to 1 year\n– At the one year mark, candidates will be asked if they would like to\nresubmit their profile\n– Candidates can update their profiles at any time if their\ncircumstances change, which may change their score\n- Candidates in the pool are ranked against others in the pool according\nto their score\n- CIC will issue Invitations to Apply to those candidates ranked highest at\na given time from the pool (frequency and volumes to be determined)\n7\nWhat is the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) and\nwhy is it necessary?",
  "78": "- The Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) is a scoring\nmechanism tied to best predictors of economic success\n- The CRS allows CIC to rank and sort submissions within\nin the Express Entry pool to identify the candidates\nmostly likely to achieve high employment earnings based\non their profile (age, education, language skills, Canadian\nwork experience) and/or a job offer or\nprovincial/territorial nomination\n- CRS ranking allows the highest scoring Express Entry\ncandidates to be invited to apply regardless of when they\nentered the Express Entry pool, instead of processing on\na first-come, first-served basis. 8\nCRS structure\nThe CRS is divided into four components:\n1. A core set of human capital factors that drive economic\noutcomes:\n- Age\n- Level of Education\n- Official Language Proficiency\n- Canadian Work Experience\n2. Spouse or Common-Law Partner factors\n3. A set of skills transferability or interaction factors that\namplify the core set\n4. Additional points awarded for those with a PT\nnomination and/or arranged employment\n9\nCRS Structure\nSpouse or Common-Law Partner\n- Each factor is assigned a points\nNO YES\nscale weighted to best reflect\nevidence on outcomes\n1. Education and experience factors\n- While the CRS is envisioned as a 500 460\nrelatively stable component of the\n2.

Invitation to Apply Mechanics\n- Whether an Express Entry candidate is issued an Invitation to Apply\n(ITA) is determined using a transparent, public and objective\nmethodology: The Comprehensive Ranking System. - Ministerial Instructions will be posted online and will contain the\ndate and time of each round of invitations, the number of\ncandidates that receive an ITA, and if it applies, which specific\nimmigration program(s) were included in the round.",
  "79": "- All rounds of invitations will be based on candidates’ rank in the\npool whether the round is for a specific immigration program or\nsimply the top ranked candidates in the pool overall. - After each round of invitations, CIC will communicate the lowest\npoints score included in the round. - If a candidate does not receive an ITA, they will be able to visit the\nCIC website and see how they fared against the cut off score. 12\nInvitation to Apply Timing\n- Rounds of invitations will be held as needed to meet\nannual levels targets. - Initial expectations are that rounds of invitations will occur\nregularly throughout the year with approximately 15 to 25\ntaking place overall. - It should be noted that the timing and the number of\ncandidates invited in each round of invitations may vary,\nallowing CIC to take into account fluctuations in the labour\nmarket or the number of candidates in the pool etc. 13\nProvinces and Territories = Key Partners\n- Provincial and territorial (P/T) nominations continue\nunder the new system. - P/Ts are able to nominate candidates who meet their\nunique regional labour market needs. - When an Express Entry candidate is identified through a\nPNP, they receive additional points in the ranking system\nand will be quickly invited to apply for permanent\nresidence. - CIC will process most applications in six months or less. *\n*80% of cases from receipt of complete application for\n14\npermanent residence to final decision.",

  "137": "APPLYING FOR A SCHENGEN VISA\nNEW VISA RULES: Please read the important information in the link, which supplements\nthe information below: new_eu_visa_rules_questions_and_answers.pdf\nThe Schengen Visa holder can travel to any of the 26 countries using one single visa, thus\navoiding the hassle and expense of obtaining individual visas for each country. The Schengen\ncountries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\nMalta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and three non-\nEU member states: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In order for applicants to know in which European Embassy they need to apply for a\nSchengen visa, they need to determine the main destination of their journey. The main\ndestination is determined by the purpose of the applicants visit:\nFor example:\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries for\nequal amount of days, the main destination is the country of point of entry;\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries but\nstay in one country longer than the other, the main destination is the country in which\nthe applicant stays the longest period of time;\n If the applicant intends to visit a Schengen country for a particular purpose (e.g. sports, culture) then the main destination is the country in which the purpose is to be\nfulfilled independent of whether other countries are visited first or for a longer period\nof time. Applicants may apply for a Schengen visa at the following European Embassies in Port of\nSpain:\n If the main destination is Estonia, Germany, Italy or Portugal: please apply at the\nEmbassy of the Federal Republic of Germany;\n If the main destination is Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands,\nLuxemburg, Norway, Poland or Sweden: please apply at the Embassy of the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands;\n If the main destination is France or Spain: please apply at the Embassy of the\nKingdom of Spain;\nTravellers to Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia and Switzerland need to consult with the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs of\nthese countries in order to obtain further information. The EU member states that are not in the Schengen area, or are yet to implement the\nSchengen Regulation are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. Short stay visitors\nto Ireland should check with the relevant authorities of that country to determine whether or\nnot they need a visa. Travellers who wish to travel to Cyprus and are holders of a valid Schengen Visa (type C,\nsingle, double or multiple entries) and who have already entered Schengen territory according\nto the stipulations governing the issuance of the Schengen Visa they hold, can travel to\nCyprus without acquiring a Cypriot Visa.",
  "138": "They can stay in the Republic of Cyprus for the\nduration of a period equal to the remainder of the period of legal stay as stated on their\nSchengen Visa and at the latest until the expiration date of their visa. Travellers to Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania are advised to contact the respective Ministries\nof Foreign Affairs for information on how to obtain a short stay visa. Additional information regarding Schengen visa requirements\nInformation for citizens of other countries who legally reside in Trinidad and Tobago:\nApplicants applying for a Schengen visa are required to comply with the EU Visa\nInformation System (VIS). The VIS is a system for the exchange of data on short-stay visas\nbetween Schengen States and it is being progressively deployed, region by region, until all\nSchengen States' consulates worldwide are connected. A simple and discreet procedure is carried out directly at the Embassy and only takes a few\nminutes. Visa applicants who are non-nationals and resident in Trinidad and Tobago will\nhave to provide their biometric data (a digital photograph and 10 fingerprint scans). Such\nbiometric data, along with the data provided in the Schengen visa application form, will be\nrecorded in the VIS central database. The recourse to biometric technology will protect visa\napplicants better against identity theft and prevent false identifications, which in certain cases\nlead to refusal of visa or entry to a person who is entitled to enter. Visa applicants will only have to provide such biometric data every 5 years. During this 5-\nyear period, the fingerprints will be copied from the first visa application, so that frequent\ntravellers will only have to complete the procedure once within this period. Exemptions from the obligation of fingerprinting are provided for the following categories of\napplicants only:\n Children under 12,\n Persons for whom the collection of fingerprints is physically impossible;\n Heads of State or government and members of a national government with\naccompanying spouses, and the members of their official delegation when they are\ninvited by Member States' governments or by international organisations for an\nofficial purpose.

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes).

  "150": "# 🇪🇺 Schengen Area — Comprehensive Visa Eligibility Reference Document\n\n*(Short-stay Schengen C visas, National D visas, residence & work rules, travel, funds, insurance, family, study — same structure as previous country docs)*\n\n> **Scope & accuracy:** This document describes stable, general Schengen visa rules and member-state practice that are appropriate for a visa-agent style RAG system. It **avoids** volatile numeric details (national fees, exact minimum bank balances) except where a single pan-Schengen rule exists (e.g., insurance minimum). Use country-specific documents (one per Schengen state) for precise, changing numbers. ---\n\n## 1. Overview — What “Schengen” means\n\n* The **Schengen Area** is a group of European countries that have abolished systematic internal border controls for travelers moving between them. * A **Schengen short-stay visa (Type C)** permits stays in the Schengen Area for **up to 90 days in any 180-day period** for tourism, business, family visits, short studies, or transit. * **National (D) visas** are issued by individual member states for longer stays (work, study, family reunification, long-term residence). Rules for D visas are decided by each member state. ---\n\n## 2. Key Universal Rules (Apply across Schengen)\n\n### 2.1 The 90/180 Rule (Short-stay limit)\n\n* A non-EU/EEA national may stay in the Schengen Area for **a maximum of 90 days within any rolling 180-day period**. * This is cumulative across all Schengen states (not per country). The 180-day window is rolling (count backwards from each day of intended stay). ### 2.2 Visa Types (Short summary)\n\n* **Type C (Schengen short-stay):** tourism, business, family visit, short studies up to 90/180. * **Type D (National):** long-stay (>90 days) for study, work, family reunification, residence. Issued by individual member states; may allow limited travel within Schengen for short periods. * **Airport Transit Visa (Type A):** transit through international transit zones at airports (rare; many nationals exempt). ### 2.3 Biometric & Application Basics\n\n* Applicants normally **must provide biometric data** (fingerprints + photo) at the visa application center (VFS/consulate), once per 59 months (approx.) unless exempt. * Schengen visas require a **personal application** (rare exceptions for children or specific categories). ### 2.4 Travel Medical Insurance (Mandatory for short-stay)\n\n* For Schengen Type C visas, travel medical insurance is **mandatory** and must cover **medical emergency and repatriation**. * **Minimum cover**: **€30,000** (this is the commonly required minimum across Schengen consulates). Insurance must be valid for the entire period of intended stay and across the whole Schengen area. ### 2.5 Purpose & Supporting Documents (Short-stay)\n\nTypical required documents (vary by consulate / nationality):\n\n* Valid passport (valid for at least 3 months beyond intended departure from Schengen; with at least two blank pages). * Completed and signed visa application form. * Recent passport-style photos. * Proof of purpose: invitation letter, hotel bookings, conference confirmation, enrolment for short course. * Proof of financial means to cover stay. * Proof of travel medical insurance. * Return/onward travel tickets or reservation. * Proof of accommodation. * Visa fee (varies). * For minors: birth certificate, parental consent, custody proof.",
  "151": "---\n\n## 3. Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10.",
  "152": "Special Categories & Practical Notes\n\n* **Visa-free travelers:** Many nationalities are exempt for short stays (e.g., U.S., Canada, Japan); check country-specific visa exemption lists. (Your RAG must consult per-country docs.) * **ETIAS (coming/operational):** Citizens of visa-exempt third countries may be required to obtain an ETIAS travel authorization in future — treat as external policy (not a visa). * **Refusal & Appeals:** Each member state has appeal or review mechanisms; timelines and procedures are country-specific. ---\n\n## 11. Fingerprints / Biometrics / Interviews\n\n* Biometrics are typically collected for short-stay visa applications and stored for **~59 months**. * Interviews are rare but may be requested at the consulate. ---\n\n## 12. What Information the Assistant MUST ask the User (to give definitive yes/no)\n\nFor Schengen short-stay eligibility and clear decisions, the assistant should request:\n\n**Mandatory for clear decision:**\n\n1. **Nationality** (passport country). 2. **Purpose of travel** (tourism, business, study <90d, family visit, transit). 3. **Dates / intended length of stay** (to check 90/180 rule). 4. **Planned Schengen countries and itinerary** (which states will be visited; main destination matters). 5. **Evidence of accommodation** (hotel booking / host address). 6. **Proof of funds or sponsor details. **\n7. **Travel medical insurance details** (provider, coverage amount, validity). 8. **Return/onward travel** (ticket/reservation). 9. **Criminal history** (if any). 10. **Previous Schengen refusals or overstays. **\n\n**For long-stay (D visa) or work/study:**\n\n* Job offer / employer name / contract (for work). * Acceptance letter, tuition (for study). * Proof of relevant qualifications, language ability (if required). * Employer work-permit details (if applicable). ---\n\n## 13. How the Assistant Should Decide (Decision Logic, Non-Hallucinated)\n\n* **If user is visa-exempt for short stays → return “Visa not required” (but check ETIAS/entry rules). **\n* **If user lacks any mandatory document (insurance, funds, passport validity, return ticket) → “Not Eligible / Insufficient documentation.”**\n* **If itinerary exceeds 90 days in 180 days or overlaps previous Schengen stays → “Not Eligible: 90/180 exceeded.”**\n* **If user has missing ties or suspicious intent to overstay → mark as “High risk” and request more evidence. **\n* **For national long-stay/working permission → check country-specific criteria (salary, labor test, institution acceptance). **\n* **Always ask for country-specific details, then consult that country doc before stating numeric thresholds. **\n\n---\n\n## 14. Example Responses / Templates (Agent Style)\n\n* **Yes (clear):** “Based on your nationality X, purpose = tourism, planned stay 7 days, valid passport and travel insurance with €30,000 cover, and proof of funds/ticket, you are eligible to apply for a Schengen short-stay visa. This is subject to consulate review.”\n* **No (clear):** “Your planned stay totals 120 days in the Schengen Area within 180 days. Under the 90/180 rule you are not eligible for a Schengen short-stay visa for that itinerary.”\n* **Insufficient information:** “I need the passport nationality, intended dates/duration, travel medical insurance details (provider & €30,000 cover), and proof of accommodation to decide.”\n\n---\n\n## 15.",

Do **not** chunk before indexing if you want retrieval to return whole doc slices; but chunking improves targeted citations. * For short-stay queries, retrieve sections: (a) 90/180 rule, (b) insurance, (c) required docs, (d) funds rules — these yield clear answers. * For country-specific numeric thresholds or work permits, chain to that country’s national doc (e.g., “Germany work permit doc”, “France student visa doc”). ---\n\n## 16. Frequently Asked Questions (that should be answerable from this doc)\n\n* “How long can I stay in Schengen without a visa?”\n* “Do I need travel insurance for Schengen?”\n* “Is 120 days tourism in multiple Schengen countries allowed?”\n* “What documents must I present for a family visit?”\n* “Do I need a national (D) visa for a 6-month course?”\n* “How much money do I need to show for a 2-week trip?” (Answer: no fixed EU wide amount; give guidance on typical weekly needs and ask for bank statements.) * “What is the 90/180 rule?” (Exact rule provided.) ---\n\n## 17. Summary Checklist (for the bot to ask & validate)\n\n* Passport nationality & expiry date (>= 3 months beyond departure). * Purpose of travel. * Exact travel dates and itinerary (main destination). * Proof of accommodation. * Travel medical insurance (provider name, coverage €30k+, valid dates). * Proof of financial means (last 3 months bank statements or sponsor proof). * Return/onward ticket. * Prior Schengen history (previous refusals/overstays). * Biometric/consulate appointment readiness.",
  "154": "What is a Schengen visa? A Schengen visa is an entry permit for non-EU nationals to make a short, temporary visit of up to 90 days in any 180-day period to a country in the Schengen area. Schengen visas come in 3 forms: \n\nsingle-entry visa - allowing you to enter the Schengen area once;\nmultiple-entry visa - allowing several visits to the Schengen area for as long as the visa is valid;\nairport transit visa - allows you to connect through the international transit area of an airport in the Schengen area during a stopover or a change of flights. It does not allow you to leave the international transit area. How long can you stay? The short-stay calculator can help you calculate the remaining period you are allowed to stay in a Schengen country. Who needs to apply for a Schengen visa? Citizens of certain non-EU countries must hold a short-stay visa when travelling to the Schengen area. Consult the EU list of countries whose citizens are required to hold a visa when crossing its external borders. There are exceptions to the visa requirements for certain types of traveller to certain countries (e.g. diplomats, armed forces, refugees, pupils on school excursions). Airport transit visas\n\nSome non-EU nationals must also hold an airport transit visa when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in any of the Schengen States. For citizens of certain additional countries, an airport transit visa is required when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in some of the Schengen countries. There are some categories of people who are exempt from the requirement to hold an airport transit visa (see Article 3(5) of the Visa Code). Where to apply\nYou must lodge your application for a Schengen visa at the consulate of the country you intend to visit. Visiting more than 1 Schengen countries: apply at the consulate of the country where you will spend the longest time. Visiting several Schengen countries (for stays of equal length): apply at the consulate of the first country you will visit. As a general rule, you must apply for a Schengen visa at the consulate with territorial responsibility for the country where you are legally resident. When to apply\nYou must submit your application to the consulate at least 15 days before your intended journey and no earlier than 6 months beforehand. You may have to book an appointment before lodging the application. What documents are needed to apply? A valid passport. The passport’s expiry date should be at least 3 months after the date of your departure from the Schengen area. For multiple-entry visas, the expiry date should be at least 3 months after your departure from the last country visited. A visa application form. A photo in compliance with ICAO standards. Medical insurance covering emergency medical care, hospitalisation and repatriation (including in the event of death).",
  "155": "Supporting documents relating to the purpose of your stay, evidence of financial means and accommodation during your stay, and evidence of your intention to return to your home country after your stay. Your fingerprints will be collected when you submit your application (exemptions exist for specific categories of applicants). Additional documents may also be requested by the consulates. How much does a visa cost? €90 for adults\n€45 for children aged 6-12\n€35 for applicants from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Belarus\n€67,50 for applicants from Cabo Verde. An additional fee may apply if you go through visa service centres, which collect applications on behalf of consulates in some cases. The visa fee can be waived for specific categories of applicants. How long does the application take to process? The normal processing time for a visa application is 15 days. This period may be extended to up to 45 days if a more detailed examination of the application and/or additional documents are required. Under certain conditions, family members of EU or EEA citizens falling under the Free Movement Directive are eligible for a free and accelerated visa procedure. Refusal of a visa application\nIf your application is rejected, you will be told:\n\nwhy it was rejected\nhow to submit an appeal. Short-stay visas for the Schengen (Types A and C)\nSo, again, the Schengen visa allows non-EU nationals to travel freely within the Schengen Area — covering most European countries — for short stays. It is also commonly referred to as the Uniform Schengen Visa (aka USV) — and generally applies to stays of up to 90 days within any 180-day period. The Uniform Schengen Visa includes the Type A visa (aka “Airport Transit” visa, or ATV) and the Type C (aka “short-stay” or “tourist”) visa. NOTE: If you want to stay in the Schengen longer than 90 days, you’ll need to opt for a Type D (aka “long-stay” or national) visa from a specific Schengen country — but more on that below!. In short, Type A is for travelers transiting through Schengen airports and Type C is for short visits (of up to 90 days) to the Schengen — such as for tourism or business (while for activities longer than 90 days — such as work, school, or residency — you’ll need Type D). So, first, here’s a more detailed breakdown of the first two:\nSchengen visa: Type A\nThe Type A Schengen visa (aka Airport Transit Visa or ATV) applies to many travelers transiting through the international zone of a Schengen airport — on their way to a non-Schengen destination, that is — without entering the Schengen Area. In other words, an ATV is mandatory for millions of travelers who are changing flights in Schengen countries — even if they do not leave the international transit area of the airport. Because — according to the European Commission — this helps both ensure security and effectively manage immigration at Schengen airports.",
  "156": "Citizens of which countries need a Schengen Airport Transit visa\nAs of late 2024, citizens of the following 12 countries* are required to apply for Type A Schengen Airport Transit visa if they’re changing flights within the Schengen Zone:\n\nAfghanistan\nBangladesh\nCongo (DR)\nEritrea\nEthiopia\nGhana\nIran\nIraq\nNigeria\nPakistan\nSomalia\nSri Lanka\n*IMPORTANT NOTES:\n\n-However, under certain conditions, some nationals of the countries listed above are exempt from a Type A visa. And to learn more, you should consult the European Union Visa Code (Article 3 – Paragraph 5). -Meanwhile, some Schengen countries require citizens from certain countries not listed above to obtain a Transit Visa (VTA) when passing through the international transit area of airports located in their territory. And to find out if these conditions apply to you, we recommend checking directly with the authorities of the Schengen countries you will be transiting through. - Moreover, if you have to leave the airport of a Schengen country for a connection at another airport (or train/bus station, etc.) and/or have a layover outside the international zone of the airport — you must apply for a Type C visa if your nationality requires one (even if it's for a short period of time)\nSchengen visa: Type C\nNow, the Type C (aka “short-stay” aka “tourist”) Schengen Visa is the most common type of visa for Europe the world over. And understandably so. Because the Type C Schengen visa ultimately allows travelers in its possession to visit and stay in one or all of the Schengen countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. As such, it’s used for anything from brief European getaways to multi-country backpacking adventures and road trips to short business trips and visiting friends and relatives in the Schengen Zone. Meanwhile, the Type C Schengen Visa is also sometimes divided into two key subcategories*, which are:\n\n-Visa with Limited Territorial Validity (aka LTV), which restricts travel to specific Schengen countries — meaning the holder cannot move freely across the entire Schengen zone— and is usually granted for humanitarian reasons or in urgent cases. -Visa Issued at the External Border, which is issued directly at border crossings for unforeseen, urgent reasons, typically valid for a very short stay, and applies only to the country issuing it. *Neither of the above visas is very common at all. The former (LTV) is issued mainly in exceptional cases (like urgent humanitarian situations) or for those whose travel documents are not accepted by all Schengen countries. Whereas the latter (“external border”) — which is even rarer — is typically issued during emergencies (like unexpected medical needs) and is generally restricted to one or two countries within the Schengen zone.",
  "157": "And, finally, depending on your particular travel needs, the Type C Schengen visa can also be issued as single, double, or multiple-entry\n\nLong-stay visa for the Schengen (Type D)\nMeanwhile, if you’re planning to stay in a particular Schengen country for more than 90 days, you’ll have to opt for what’s known as the Type D (aka “long stay”, aka “national”) visa. And this part is a bit tricky. Namely because — while issued by a Schengen country — a long-stay national visa (Type D) is not technically considered “a Schengen visa” in the traditional sense. Instead, the Type D visa is issued by a single Schengen member state to individuals intending to stay longer than 90 days in that particular country — for purposes such as work, training programs, internships, school, family reunification, and so on. However, while the visa primarily grants access to one particular Schengen country, it does also allow its holder to travel freely within the Schengen Area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period during their visa's validity — thus making it similar to the Type C visa. So while a Type D visa is not a \"Schengen visa\" per se, it does allow movement within the Schengen Area under certain conditions. Business, work, and student Schengen Visas\nDepending on the nature of your particular trip, your Schengen (and/or national) visa can also come in the form of business, work, or study. These subcategories are fairly self-explanatory and do not generally apply to the Schengen Type A (aka ATV “airport transit”) visa. However, they can be used for both short and long stays in the Schengen (i.e., either the Type C or Type D visas) — depending on your particular trip. So if you’re not just vacationing in Europe but rather going on business or to work or study, AXA can also gladly tell you all you need to know below:\n\nWhat is a Schengen business visa (and how do I get one)? What is a Schengen work visa (and how do I get one)? How to get a work visa for France\nHow to get a work visa for Germany\nWhat is a Schengen student visa (and how do I get one)? Single-Entry, Double-Entry, and Multiple-Entry Schengen Visas\nAnd, finally, you also have three options in terms of how often you want to enter the Schengen Zone for your European trip. And here’s a breakdown of those three Schengen visa types*:\n\nSingle-Entry Visa:\n\nAllows you to enter the Schengen Area only once. After you leave, the visa becomes invalid (and that’s even if its validity period hasn't expired). Marked with a \"1\" on the visa sticker\n\nPRO-TIP: AXA can tell you all about how to read your Schengen Visa Sticker and Number too. Double-Entry Visa:\nGrants two entries into the Schengen Area — meaning you can leave and re-enter once within the visa's validity period (perfect for a side trip to a Schengen-neighboring country, for example).",
  "158": "After the second exit, the visa becomes void. Marked with a \"2\" on the visa sticker. Multiple-Entry Visa:\nAllows unlimited entries and exits within the visa's validity period — so long as you respect the 90/180 rule (i.e., that your stay/travels do not exceed 90 days within any 180-day period). Marked with \"MULT\" on the visa sticker. PRO-TIPS: AXA can tell you more about the multiple-entry Schengen visa and Schengen visa first point of entry rules too! *And keep in mind that while the single-entry, double-entry, and multiple-entry visa rules primarily apply to Type C visas, Type D long-stay visas can also be issued as single-entry or multiple-entry — depending on the specific country’s national regulations and your particular situation. IMPORTANT NOTE: Remember that Schengen visa regulations in general tend to change often.

What if I no longer look like my photo? Even if you have changed appearance - by growing your hair or obtaining glasses - the nature of a biometric photo means you should still be identifiable.

And although travel to, from, and between Europe’s Schengen countries remains relatively easy, it does come at a certain cost. And — if you need to apply for a Schengen visa — that’s literally speaking.",
  "161": "That’s because one of the basic requirements for being granted a Schengen visa is that you pay a mandatory standard fee. That fee, meanwhile, has recently undergone a few changes of its own (heads-up — it hasn’t gotten any cheaper). And while AXA is just the messenger here, below is a general breakdown of the new costs and specifics behind them. How much is a Schengen visa? Is the visa fee the same for all Schengen countries? Are there any additional costs to consider? Are there any circumstances when the Schengen visa fee can be waived? How can AXA help? Everything else you need to know about the Schengen visa\nHow much is a Schengen visa? The main body actually responsible for deciding how much a Schengen visa costs is the European Commission. And every three years or so, it tends to revise (and consequently increase) those costs in what it calls an \"amendment to the Visa Code.” The last amendment was in January 2020, and it resulted in an increase from €60 to 80€ for adults and from €35 to €40 for kids 6-12yo. In early 2024, the Commission had assessed the need to revise the visa fee amounts again. And this time around — by a total of 12%. So as of June 11, 2024, the new standard fees for being granted a Schengen visa are as follows: \n\n€90 for adults; \n€45 for children between the ages of six and 12. The good news? Children under the age of six can still get a Schengen visa for free. Why have the prices been increased? Well, there are likely several reasons. But to quote the official sources above, “this calculation is based on the EU-wide inflation rate and salary developments for national civil servants over the past 3 years.” \nWhy have the prices been increased? Well, there are likely several reasons. But to quote the official sources above, “this calculation is based on the EU-wide inflation rate and salary developments for national civil servants over the past 3 years.” \n\nIn other words, the fee hike is an effort to adapt to rising administrative (and other) costs, ensure better resources and conditions for consular and visa-processing service workers, and so on. Meanwhile, our guess is that the increase will also likely help cover costs associated with certain planned technological advancements by the EU — mainly designed to help streamline the Schengen visa application process (and border controls in general). For example, programs like ETIAS, EES, and even the EU’s eventual plan to bring the whole Schengen visa application process online — although all still very much in the works — will likely all cost the EU a pretty penny. But, again, we’re just the messenger here — and, outside the official sources, your guess is as good as ours. The one thing that is clear?",
  "162": "If you’re hoping for a Schengen visa in the near future, you’ll need to shell out an extra standard 5 to 10 bucks (compared to the former standard fee, that is). Is the visa fee the same for all Schengen countries? Fortunately, yes. As of mid-2024, the Schengen visa fee remains standardized across all Schengen countries. So while the individual costs of goods and services may vary from country to country quite significantly, Schengen visa applicants pay the same fee regardless of which Schengen country they apply to — be it France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and so on. Is the visa fee the same for all Schengen visas? Not necessarily. That is, the standard fee applies to a short-stay (aka Type C or “tourist”) visa. A Type C visa is the most common type of Schengen visa, and it allows you to visit the Schengen — for up to 90 days within a 180-day period — for tourism, business, and/or family visits. However, different fees may apply for other types of Schengen visas — such as long-stay visas for work, study, and so on. The reason being that these are generally subject to the specific regulations (and, therefore, fees) of the individual Schengen member state you are applying to. On the other hand, there may also be exemptions for certain categories of applicants — i.e., students, researchers, participants in cultural, sporting, or educational events, and so on.​\nWhy have the prices been increased?

Yes, there are certain circumstances under which the Schengen visa fee can be waived. Applicants that may benefit from fee exemptions include — well, again, kids under six years of age, but also certain school pupils, students, and accompanying teachers on school trips. Additionally, researchers traveling for scientific research purposes and representatives of non-profit organizations (aged 25 or less) participating in seminars, conferences, and/or sports, cultural, or educational events may also have their fees waived. Further, some countries might offer exemptions based on bilateral agreements​ for civil workers, diplomats, and so on. So make sure you do your homework and reach out to the embassy/consulate (and/or visa application center) of your destination country of choice to see how your particular travel reason may benefit you. PRO-TIP: The EU also has a bunch of helpful info via its Immigration Portal and Migration and Home Affairs websites. Are there any additional costs to consider? And keep in mind that — if you’re not exempt — the actual amount you pay when applying for your Schengen visa will likely vary too. In other words, expect to spend a bit more than just the standard fee above. First off, because individual Schengen countries might impose additional administrative fees and service charges through their consulates, embassies, and/or visa application centers​. Furthermore, costs for obtaining (and/or translating) certain required documents — such as bank statements, employment letters, and so on — can add to your overall expenses.

  "165": "Yes! AXA will refund your insurance fees if your visa application is rejected in most cases. We’ll only ask that you provide official documentation explaining why your visa was refused (from the relevant embassy, consulate, or visa application center). Will it cost more to obtain a longer-stay Schengen Visa? Generally speaking, there is little difference — as the fee covers the costs of processing your application. However, longer-stay visa applications to work or study are dealt with at a national level — so the requirements may vary, and your destination country may ask you to pay fees covering additional documentation. Can I work or study in the Schengen Zone on a tourist visa? No. While the tourist (or Type C) allows visitors to enter the Schengen for a short business trip, a holiday, and/or to visit family members, it cannot be converted into a work or study permit. AXA can tell you more. What should I do if my visa is refused? You can either apply again or appeal. The EU’s Article 32(3) of the Visa Code of the Schengen Agreement can tell you more — but the outcome of your appeal will ultimately depend on the individual Schengen country’s authorities. How to apply for a Schengen business visa to Europe? Travel Insurance is mandatory to obtain a Schengen visa\n\nWritten by: Kurt Hambadda\nPublished on: 07/18/2025\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (aka IATA), roughly 600 million business trips are taken globally each year. And a good chunk of these, of course, happens to be to, from, and throughout the most visited continent on the planet – aka Europe. If you too are planning to be among the thousands of people saying “business” at a European airport on any given day, you might be wondering about the right type of visa for your trip. And that’s why AXA has all you need to know about the Schengen business visa below. What is a Schengen Business Visa? Who needs a Schengen Business visa? What are the main requirements for a Business Schengen Visa application? Where and when should I apply for a Business Schengen Visa? Tips to complete the application process for a Business Schengen Visa\nWhy choose AXA Travel Insurance for my Business Schengen Visa? Schengen Business Visa FAQ\nWhat Is a Schengen Business Visa? As its name suggests, a Schengen Business Visa is essentially a type of short-stay (aka Type C) Schengen visa ​–​this one designed specifically for non EU/EEA nationals traveling to the Schengen Area for business-related activities. Think meetings, conferences, contract negotiations, industry events, and so on (IMPORTANT: However, don’t think full-time employment–but more on that in our FAQs section below). Being granted a Schengen Business Visa (or a Business Schengen visa, if you prefer as they’re interchangeable) allows you to enter not just one but any of Europe’s dozens of Schengen countries. And, once there, it also offers you the freedom to cross any of their borders, and without needing any other separate visas.",
  "166": "That is, so long as your trip doesn’t exceed 90 days within any 180-day period. PRO-BUSINESS TIP: Don’t worry, AXA can gladly help you wrap your head around the 90/180 Schengen visa rule too. Do I need a Schengen Business visa? That depends. Generally speaking, if you’re one of the 5-6 billion nationals of over 100 countries worldwide that don't have a visa-free agreement with the Schengen Area, you’ll need a Schengen visa to enter most of Europe–be it for business or anything else. And if you’re trying to enter Europe for professional reasons (i.e., to buy, sell, attend meetings and/or conferences, sign contracts, network at trade shows, and so on), the visa you apply for is going to have to be… You guessed it: a business Schengen visa. Also keep in mind that if you only plan to stay in Europe for a few days, a visa is still most likely required. And the same goes for even if your company (or employer, client, etc.) is footing the bill for your trip. But but more on that below! PRO-BUSINESS TIPS: And fear not! AXA can help you figure out who needs a Schengen visa and who doesn’t need a Schengen visa in no time too. IMPORTANT PRO-TIP: Meanwhile, if you're from a country whose citizens don’t need a Schengen visa (i.e., Canada, the U.K., the U.S., and roughly 60 more), you typically should be ok for short business trips under 90 days. However, you’ll still likely need at least some paperwork attesting to the trip’s “business” nature. In other words, whether you need that visa or not, it’s still always best to check with the authorities (i.e., consulates and/or embassies) of the specific Schengen state you plan to visit beforehand. What Are the Main Requirements for a Business Schengen Visa Application? Along with meeting the general requirements for a Schengen visa, you must also prove that your trip is for genuine business activities (i.e., attending meetings, conferences, trade shows, and so on). And depending on your particular situation–as well as the specific Schengen authorities–this proof can be in the form of an invitation and/or sponsorship letter (see below! ), a conference registration, a meeting agenda, a contract or other official business-related documents, and the like. Which documents do I need to provide for a Business Schengen Visa? You’ll also, at the very least, likely need the following:\n\nCompleted and signed Schengen visa application form\nTwo passport-sized photos (matching Schengen visa photo requirements)\nProof of Schengen travel medical insurance (PRO-BUSINESS TIP: Proper travel insurance is mandatory to be granted a Schengen visa and all of AXA’s plans are proper indeed!) Your flight itinerary\n​​Proof of accommodation (if applicable)\nProof of means of subsistence (if applicable)\nWhat documents do I need from my company or business partner for the application? Your company or business partner must indeed provide at least some official documentation to support your application.",
  "167": "However, specifically what that documentation is can be as varied as there are ways of doing business! Usually, though, this will include a formal invitation letter outlining the purpose and length of your visit, evidence of the ongoing business relationship, a bank statement or two, proof of who (and how) is footing the bill, and so on. PRO-BUSINESS TIPS: Luckily, AXA can also gladly guide you, step by step, through the processes of getting both an invitation letter and a letter of sponsorship for your Schengen visa (be it business or other), respectively. Where and When Should I Apply for a Business Schengen Visa? In terms of where and when, the Schengen business visa application process is pretty universal. Apply at the embassy, consulate, or visa application center of the Schengen country you plan to do business in, the one where you will spend the most time, or–if your stay is equally split between countries– at the embassy of the Schengen country you plan to enter first. Time-wise, all Schengen visa applications –be it business or any other type– should be submitted no earlier than six months and no later than 15 days before your trip. But, again, it’s best to check the specific Schengen embassy/consulate’s official websites for any local appointment or documentation requirements (and you can see our FINAL PRO-TIP below for more on those). How much does a Business Schengen Visa cost? ​​​​And the same goes for the costs. That is, although some additional fees may vary from country to country if you’re applying through a visa center, what you pay for the Schengen visa itself remains universal no matter where you’re going (or what type of visa you’re applying for). take a look at AXA’s comprehensive Schengen visa costs guide. What is the difference between a Business Visa and a Work Visa? Great question. In a nutshell, a Business Visa allows short stays for activities like meetings or conferences, while a Work Visa permits actual employment within the Schengen Area. PRO-BUSINESS TIP: But to better answer it, AXA has all you need to know about a Schengen work visa too. How long is a Business Schengen Visa valid? Traditionally, it’s valid for up to 90 days within any 180-day period (see our piece on this rule above). PRO-BUSINESS TIP: Oh, and we’ve also got all you need to know about both Schengen visa validity (and Schengen visa extension) just in case too. How many entries does a Business Schengen Visa allow? That depends on what type of visa you request (and what the Schengen authorities grant, of course). For example, you can get a single-entry, double-entry, or multiple-entry visa. And all three are fairly self-explanatory. A single-entry is more common for first-time business travelers, while the double-entry and multiple-entry Schengen visa is usually approved for frequent flyers (and/or those who’ve previously held Schengen visas). But regardless of entries, you’re still bound by the aforementioned 90/180-day rule.",
  "168": "PRO-BUSINESS TIP: AXA can familiarize you with all the different types of Schengen visas in no time as well. Is travel insurance mandatory for a Business Schengen Visa application? Yes, to be granted your visa, you must have a Schengen travel insurance plan when you apply. And said plan, in turn, should:\n\nbe purchased from an insurance company validated by the consular authorities of all Schengen countries;\nhave a minimum coverage of €30,000 (in case of medical care, hospitalization, and/or medical repatriation);\nbe accepted by all countries within the Schengen zone;\nbe valid for the entire duration of your trip. And it goes without saying that all of AXA’s plans meet the criteria above. How long does it take to get a Business Schengen Visa? Processing typically takes 15 calendar days but can be longer during peak seasons (and/or depending on your particular situation). What are the most common reasons for Business Schengen Visa refusal? Your Schengen business visa might be refused due to one (or more) of the following:\n\nIncomplete or incorrect application\nInsufficient proof of business purpose\nPrevious visa violations or overstays\nDoubts (from the Schengen authorities) about your financial means, return intentions, and so on\nLack of valid travel insurance (hint hint)\nWhat should I do if my Business Schengen Visa application is rejected? In the off-chance that your Schengen visa is refused, you can either appeal the decision or reapply with corrected documentation. In any case, consult your destination Schengen embassy’s website (and/or representatives) for further guidance.

Tips to complete the application process for a Business Schengen Visa\nSo, to summarize, here’s how you can help guarantee that you can take your Schengen business visa to the bank:\n\nFamiliarize yourself and your business partner(s) with your Schengen destination country’s specific rules, requirements, and regulations;\nDouble-check all documents for accuracy and completeness before submission;\nClearly demonstrate the business purpose (with official invitations, contracts, and so on);\nApply early to allow time for processing (and/or margins for error);\nKeep copies of all submitted documents for your records (and, of course, get as much as you can in writing);\nConsult with AXA’s comprehensive guide above;\nPurchase top-quality travel insurance that meets all Schengen requirements.

There’s no such thing as a ’Schengen work visa’. You can only work in Schengen nations for long periods if you have a National D-type Work visa, which is issued by the country you are planning to work in - and will not entitle you to work in another state. However, if you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work reasons and your trip will last fewer than 90 days, then you can apply for a short-stay Schengen work visa allowing you to fulfill your business obligations. You will need to provide evidence that work is the purpose of your trip to be issued with a short-stay visa equivalent to the length of your posting in your desired Schengen Area. You must leave your host country before the expiry date shown on your visa. If your obligations exceed 90 days, you need a long-stay work visa type D. You may also need to validate it within three months following your arrival. What different types of Schengen visas exist ? How do I get a European work permit?

  "260": "UK VISA SCREENING – DOCUMENT CHECKLIST AND GUIDANCE (2025)\nSource basis: This guide is based primarily on the official UK government guidance for the\nStudent visa “Documents you’ll need to apply” and related pages (tuberculosis testing,\nEnglish language evidence, ATAS) together with checklists published by UK universities and\nadvisory organisations. It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening”\npurposes and is not a legal document. Always cross‑check with the latest guidance on\nGOV.UK before applying. ------------------------------------------------------------\n1. INTRODUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you apply for a UK Student visa, the decision maker (UK Visas and Immigration –\nUKVI) checks that you:\n- are a genuine student with an unconditional offer;\n- will study an approved course at a licensed sponsor;\n- can support yourself financially and pay your tuition fees;\n- meet health and character requirements; and\n- have provided all mandatory supporting documents. This checking process is often called visa “screening”. If any required evidence is missing or\ndoes not meet the format rules, UKVI can refuse the application even if you are otherwise\neligible. This document is designed as a training resource for building a UK visa‑screening\nsystem: it expands the official document list into a detailed, structured checklist that a\nsystem can use to verify whether the applicant has collected the correct evidence. The guide focuses on the standard Student visa route (for courses longer than 6 months)\nmade from outside the UK. Many of the requirements are also relevant to applications made\nwithin the UK, but some details differ. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE MANDATORY DOCUMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Current passport or travel document\nEvery applicant must provide a valid passport or other travel document. Key screening points:\n- The document must be valid on the date you submit the application and when you travel\nto the UK. - It should contain at least one blank page (front and back) so the visa vignette can be\nplaced in it if an eVisa is not used. - The personal details page must be clearly readable and not damaged. - If the passport will expire very soon after arrival, applicants are strongly advised to renew\nit before applying, because replacing a passport from abroad can be difficult. Evidence format:\n- Original physical passport (for in‑person biometrics) or electronic copy if applying using\nthe UK Immigration ID Check app. - If you hold more than one nationality, you may need to declare and provide details of all\npassports. 2.2 Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\nThe second mandatory document is a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) issued\nby a licensed Student sponsor (usually your university or college). The CAS is an electronic\nrecord, not a paper letter, but universities often provide a CAS statement for your reference. Key screening points:\n- CAS reference number: you must enter this correctly in the online application form. - The CAS must be issued by a sponsor with a valid Student sponsor licence.",
  "261": "- The CAS must be for the course you intend to study and must not have been used in a\nprevious visa application that was granted or is still pending. - The CAS will contain key details such as course title, level, start and end dates, tuition fees\nfor the first year or whole course, and any fees already paid. System‑level checks for visa screening:\n- Validate that a CAS number has been entered. - Confirm that the course level meets the Student visa rules (for example, RQF level 3 or\nabove for further education, or degree‑level study). - Confirm that the course start date is within the permitted timeframe for applying. - Record the tuition fee amount and any pre‑paid tuition/accommodation fees because\nthese affect the financial requirement. ------------------------------------------------------------\n3. FINANCIAL EVIDENCE (MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOfficial guidance says you may need to provide proof that you have enough money to\nsupport yourself and pay your tuition fees. The exact amount depends on course location,\nlength and how long you have already lived in the UK. 3.1 What you usually need to show\nFor most first‑time applications made outside the UK, the applicant must show:\n- Remaining tuition fees for the first year of the course (or for the full course if it lasts 12\nmonths or less), minus any fees already paid to the university and confirmed on the CAS. - Living costs (also called “maintenance funds”) for up to 9 months, calculated using Home\nOffice rates, e.g. :\n– a monthly amount for London;\n– a slightly lower monthly amount for cities outside London. (Exact monetary values change over time and should be taken from the current guidance.) 3.2 Types of acceptable financial documents\nCommon types of evidence include:\na) Personal bank statements\n- Must show the required funds held for a continuous period (often 28 days) ending no\nmore than 31 days before the application date. - Statement must include: account holder’s name, account number, financial institution\nname and logo, and all transactions/balances for the period. - Screenshots or online print‑outs are acceptable only if they contain all required details\nand are clearly from a regulated bank. b) Fixed‑deposit certificates or savings accounts\n- Must be in an account that allows the funds to be withdrawn. - Evidence should show that the deposit can be accessed immediately, not locked beyond\nthe application date. c) Parents’ or legal guardians’ finances\n- Allowed if you are using a parent’s or guardian’s bank account. - Must provide:\n– Bank statements in the parent/guardian’s name; and\n– Proof of relationship (for example, birth certificate, adoption certificate or court\ndocument); and\n– A signed letter from the parent/guardian confirming that the funds will be used to\nsupport your study and living costs in the UK. d) Official financial sponsorship\n- A letter from a government body, international scholarship agency, university, or\ninternational company confirming that they will cover some or all of your tuition fees and\nliving costs.",
  "262": "- The letter must be on official letterhead, dated, signed and include:\n– Sponsor’s name and contact details;\n– Applicant’s name;\n– Duration of sponsorship; and\n– Amount or full coverage of costs. 3.3 Screening rules for financial documents\nA visa‑screening system should check:\n- Is financial evidence required for this applicant? – Applicants extending their visa from inside the UK after 12 continuous months of lawful\nresidence may not need to show funds. - Are documents dated within the permitted period? - Does the total balance meet or exceed the calculated requirement (tuition + maintenance\nminus allowed deductions)? - Do the documents cover a full continuous 28‑day period (or other period stated in current\nrules)? - Are funds in a permitted currency and held in an acceptable financial institution? - If using parents’ funds, is relationship evidence and consent letter present? - If the applicant received official sponsorship within the last 12 months and that\nsponsorship has ended, do they have written consent from the previous sponsor allowing\nthem to remain and re‑enter the UK? 3.4 Common financial refusal reasons\n- Funds held for fewer than 28 continuous days. - Evidence older than 31 days on the date of application. - Using an account belonging to someone else without showing relationship and consent. - Submitting financial documents from an unregulated or banned financial institution. - Miscalculating the required amount, especially for dependants or London vs outside\nLondon. ------------------------------------------------------------\n4. ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND ATAS EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4.1 Proving knowledge of English\nFor most Student visa applications, you must show that you can speak, read, write and\nunderstand English to a certain level. Evidence may include:\n- An academic qualification taught in English and accepted by UKVI as meeting the\nrequirement; or\n- An approved English language test (for example IELTS for UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI or\nsimilar) at the level appropriate for your course; or\n- Being a national of a majority English‑speaking country listed by the Home Office; or\n- Having completed a degree‑level qualification in the UK previously. Screening checks:\n- Does the course require English evidence based on its level and whether it is below degree\nlevel? - If a test certificate is used:\n– Is the test provider on the list of approved Secure English Language Test (SELT)\nproviders? – Is the test still valid on the date of application? – Are the scores at or above the minimum for the CAS/course level? 4.2 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\nFor certain postgraduate courses in sensitive subjects (mainly science, engineering and\ntechnology fields), students of specific nationalities must obtain an ATAS certificate before\napplying for a visa. Key points:\n- The CAS will normally state whether ATAS is required and include the relevant subject\ncode. - The ATAS certificate is issued as a digital letter. It must be valid (usually 6 months) when\nthe visa application is submitted. - If ATAS is required and not provided, the visa will be refused.",
  "263": "Screening checks:\n- Check CAS to see if ATAS is required. - Confirm that an ATAS certificate is attached and that:\n– The course details and institution match the CAS; and\n– The applicant’s personal details match the rest of the application; and\n– The decision date on the certificate is within the allowed period. ------------------------------------------------------------\n5. TUBERCULOSIS (TB) TEST CERTIFICATE\n------------------------------------------------------------\nStudents coming to the UK for more than 6 months from certain listed countries must\nprovide a tuberculosis (TB) test certificate from a Home Office‑approved clinic. Key information from the TB guidance:\n- You need a TB test if:\n– You are coming to the UK for more than 6 months; and\n– You have lived in one of the listed countries for 6 months or more; and\n– You were living in that country (or another listed country) within the last 6 months. - The test is usually a chest x‑ray. If the x‑ray is unclear, you may need a sputum (phlegm)\ntest. - If the test shows you do not have TB, you receive a certificate that is valid for 6 months\nfrom the date of the x‑ray. - Children must attend an approved clinic. Children under 11 usually do not need a chest\nx‑ray, but a medical practitioner must complete a questionnaire and issue a certificate if the\nchild is TB‑free. - There are separate options for pregnant applicants (shielded x‑ray, sputum test, or\npostponing the test until after delivery). Screening checks:\n- Is the applicant applying from a TB‑listed country, or have they recently lived there? - Is the course longer than 6 months (Student visa normally is)? - If yes, has the applicant provided a TB certificate issued by an approved clinic? - Is the certificate:\n– Less than 6 months old on the date of application? – Clearly matching the applicant’s identity details? - For dependants applying with the student, each dependant from a TB‑listed country must\nalso provide a TB certificate. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6. APPLICANTS UNDER 18 – PARENTAL CONSENT AND RELATIONSHIP EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are under 18 at the time of application, you must provide extra documents to show\nthat your parents or legal guardians consent to your study and living arrangements in the\nUK. 6.1 Parental or guardian consent\nYou normally need written consent from both parents, or the one parent who has sole legal\nresponsibility, or your legal guardian(s). The consent letter must:\n- State that they consent to your Student visa application;\n- Confirm that they agree with your living and care arrangements in the UK; and\n- Confirm that they consent to your travel to and from the UK. For screening, check that:\n- The letter is signed and dated. - The names in the letter match the names on your birth certificate or guardianship\ndocuments. - The letter clearly mentions all three areas of consent (application, living/care\narrangements, and travel).",
  "264": "6.2 Proof of relationship\nYou must also provide evidence of your relationship to your parent(s) or guardian(s). Typical documents include:\n- Birth certificate showing the names of both parents;\n- Adoption certificate;\n- Court order or legal document confirming guardianship. These documents must be original or properly certified copies. If they are not in English or\nWelsh, an official translated version must also be provided. ------------------------------------------------------------\n7. PREVIOUS SPONSORSHIP CONSENT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf, in the last 12 months, you were financially sponsored by a government or an\ninternational scholarship agency for both tuition fees and living costs, and that sponsorship\nhas ended, you must provide a letter from that sponsor giving you unconditional consent to\nremain or re‑enter the UK for further study. The consent letter should:\n- Be on official letterhead;\n- Include your full name and, ideally, your date of birth or passport number;\n- Confirm that the sponsor supports your new course in the UK and has no objection to your\nvisa application; and\n- Be signed, dated and include contact information of an authorised official. Screening rule:\n- If an applicant declares previous full sponsorship, the file must contain this consent letter. Without it, the visa can be refused even if financial funds are otherwise sufficient. ------------------------------------------------------------\n8. ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDepending on your level of study and nationality, you may be required to submit academic\nqualifications listed on your CAS. 8.1 When qualifications are required\n- If you are studying below degree level and are not from a “differential evidence” country,\nyou must normally submit the qualification documents used to obtain your offer (for\nexample, school certificates, college transcripts). - If you are from a differential evidence country or studying at degree level or above, you\nmay not have to upload documents with your application, but you must keep them ready\nbecause UKVI can request them during screening. Common types of academic evidence:\n- Certificates of qualification (for example, 12th grade mark sheet, bachelor’s degree\ncertificate);\n- Official transcripts of results, stamped or sealed by the institution;\n- Printouts of results from an awarding body’s secure online verification system. Screening checks:\n- Do the qualification names and grades match the details in the CAS? - Are documents genuine‑looking (correct logos, spelling, signatures, seals)? - If any document is not in English or Welsh, is a certified translation attached? ------------------------------------------------------------\n9. TRANSLATIONS AND DOCUMENT FORMAT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny supporting document that is not in English or Welsh must be accompanied by a fully\ncertified translation. The translation must:\n- Be done by a professional translator or translation company;\n- Include confirmation that it is an accurate translation of the original document;\n- Include the date of translation;\n- Include the translator’s or translation company’s full name and contact details; and\n- Bear the translator’s signature. Screening checks:\n- For every non‑English/Welsh document, confirm that a corresponding translation is\npresent and meets the above requirements.",
  "265": "- Verify that the information in the translation matches the original document (names,\ndates, numbers). ------------------------------------------------------------\n10. DEPENDANT FAMILY MEMBERS\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSome students are allowed to bring dependants (partner and children) to the UK. The\ncurrent Student visa rules restrict who can bring dependants, and these rules change over\ntime, so they must always be checked against the latest official guidance. Typical evidence for dependants includes:\n- Marriage or civil partnership certificate (for partners);\n- Birth certificate for each child;\n- Evidence that the relationship is genuine and subsisting (for example, joint bank accounts,\njoint tenancy agreements, photos, communication history), if requested;\n- Additional financial evidence to show that you have enough money to support each\ndependant for the required number of months, on top of your own maintenance\nrequirement;\n- TB test certificates for dependants from listed countries. A visa‑screening system should be able to:\n- Detect when an application includes dependants;\n- Calculate extra maintenance funds required for each dependant; and\n- Verify that relationship documents and TB certificates are present for each dependant, if\nrelevant. ------------------------------------------------------------\n11. IDENTITY VERIFICATION, BIOMETRICS AND INTERVIEW\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAlthough not “documents” in the traditional sense, identity verification steps are part of the\nscreening process. 11.1 Biometrics appointment or ID Check app\nMost applicants must either:\n- Attend a visa application centre, where fingerprints and a digital photograph are taken; or\n- Use the UK Immigration ID Check app to scan their passport chip and upload a selfie. The data collected is used to:\n- Confirm your identity;\n- Produce a visa vignette or eVisa record; and\n- Cross‑check against immigration and security databases. 11.2 Credibility interviews\nIn some cases, UKVI may invite you to a short interview, often via video link. You may be\nasked about:\n- Your course choice and knowledge of the university;\n- How you will fund your studies and living costs;\n- Your previous academic background; and\n- Your plans after completing the course. While these are not documents, they are part of the overall “screening” of a Student visa\napplication. Your answers should be consistent with the documents you provided. ------------------------------------------------------------\n12. HIGH‑LEVEL CHECKLIST FOR A UK STUDENT VISA SCREENING SYSTEM\n------------------------------------------------------------\nBelow is an example of how an automated or semi‑automated screening checklist might be\nstructured. Each item corresponds to one or more documents and rules described earlier. A. Identity and course details\n1. Valid passport or travel document uploaded and readable. 2. CAS reference number provided and valid. 3. Course level and start date meet Student visa requirements. B. Financial requirement\n4. Tuition fee amount and any pre‑payments recorded from CAS. 5. Living‑cost requirement calculated according to location and duration. 6. Financial documents provided in an acceptable format (bank statements,\nsponsor letters, etc.). 7. Funds held for at least the required continuous period and are recent\nenough. 8. If using parent/guardian funds: relationship evidence and consent letter\npresent. 9. If previously officially sponsored within the last 12 months: sponsor consent\nletter attached.",
  "266": "C. English language and ATAS\n10. Appropriate English language evidence provided where required. 11. If course requires ATAS: ATAS certificate attached and valid. D. Health requirements\n12. TB certificate provided if applicant or dependants meet the criteria. 13. Certificate issued by a Home Office‑approved clinic and still within validity. E. Age and parental consent\n14. Applicant’s age verified. 15. If under 18: parental/guardian consent letter(s) attached. 16. Relationship evidence (birth/adoption certificate, court order) attached. F. Academic and course‑related evidence\n17. Academic qualification documents provided where required by CAS and rules. 18. All non‑English/Welsh documents accompanied by certified translations. G. Dependants (if applicable)\n19. For each dependant:\n– Relationship evidence attached (marriage/birth certificate);\n– TB certificate attached if required;\n– Extra funds included in financial calculations. H. Process completion\n20. Biometrics or ID Check app process scheduled/completed. 21. Application form submitted with consistent information across all sections. 22. Application fee and Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) paid. ------------------------------------------------------------\n13. CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe UK Student visa process is rule‑based and document‑heavy. Many refusals arise from\nmissing, inconsistent or incorrectly formatted documents rather than from ineligibility. A\nrobust visa‑screening system should therefore:\n- Mirror the official GOV.UK structure: “Check if this visa is right for you”, “Prepare the\nevidence you need”, “Apply”, and so on. - Provide dynamic checklists based on the applicant’s circumstances (age, nationality,\nwhere they apply from, dependants, previous sponsorship). - Guide applicants step by step to upload each required document in the correct format. - Highlight high‑risk areas, such as financial evidence and TB certificates, where refusals are\ncommon. - Store structured metadata (for example, document type, issue date, issuing authority,\ncurrency, balance) so that automated validation rules can be applied. For real visa applications, applicants must always rely on the most recent Home Office\nguidance and, where necessary, professional immigration advice. However, this document\ngives a comprehensive, structured view of the evidence typically needed for UK Student visa\nscreening and can be used both as a learning aid and as source material inside a\nRetrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system for query answering.",

Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes.",
  "268": "It is based on official GOV.UK guidance and Home Office publications. Numbers (salary thresholds, maintenance amounts, IHS rates) are explicitly taken from GOV.UK pages cited below. Where policy varies by occupation code or sponsor, the document points to the authoritative tables (going-rates / immigration salary list). Do not treat this as legal advice — final decisions are made by UKVI caseworkers at application time. ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSECTION A — SUPPORTED ROUTES (covered here)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Skilled Worker (sponsored work visa)\n2. Student (Student route — academic & postgraduate study)\n3. Visitor / Standard Visitor (tourism, family, business)\n4.

General items: Health (IHS), TB tests, evidence, refusal reasons\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSECTION B — SKILLED WORKER (employer-sponsored)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nOVERVIEW\nThe Skilled Worker route requires a UK employer with a sponsor licence to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for a named job. Applicants must meet job, salary and (where required) English language requirements. Final eligibility and supporting evidence are assessed by UKVI. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n\nKEY RULES (must be satisfied):\n- Sponsor: job must be sponsored by a Home Office-licensed sponsor who issues a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} \n- Skill level: the job must meet the minimum occupation skill level (RQF level 3 or above — check official occupation codes). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} \n- Salary requirement: **you must be paid the higher of**:\n 1. The **standard salary** threshold for the Skilled Worker route, OR \n 2. The **going rate** (annual going rate) for the specific occupation code (SOC code). Current standard salary (public guidance): **£41,700 per year** (usual standard annual salary). If the going rate for the specific job is higher, that higher figure applies. Some listed occupations have a **reduced minimum (80% rule)**; consult the immigration salary list for details. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\n\n- Exceptions / lower thresholds:\n - If the job appears on the **Immigration Salary List** (shortage occupations or listed routes), a lower minimum salary (for example 80% of the usual rate) may apply — check the salary list for exact codes and rates. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\n\n- English language: applicants must meet the specified English language level or hold an acceptable qualification unless exempt. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}\n\nEVIDENCE (commonly requested):\n- Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) with job details and SOC code. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} \n- Contract / employer letter specifying duties, hours, salary and start date. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} \n- Proof employer is a licensed sponsor (sponsor licence number appears on CoS). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nAGE, INCOME & OTHER NOTES:\n- **Age:** No statutory maximum or minimum age for Skilled Worker applicants; eligibility hinges on job, sponsor, skill level and salary. (Age alone is not a legal disqualifier.) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} \n- **Applicant’s prior/home-country income:** Not relevant for meeting the Skilled Worker route salary rule — the UK job salary is the key metric. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}\n\nCOMMON REFUSAL REASONS:\n- Salary below the required threshold (standard or going rate). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} \n- Incorrect/invalid CoS or sponsor issues.",

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer.",
  "282": "If degree not held, evidence of equivalent education + progressive work experience may be considered. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\n\nF-1 (Student) — Core criteria & funds\n- To get an F-1 visa, applicant must be accepted by a SEVP-certified school and receive Form I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility). The school will require proof of sufficient funds before issuing an I-20. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\n- “Proof of sufficient funds” commonly means documentation that covers: first year’s tuition (or full tuition paid), living expenses for the duration of study, and return transportation. Acceptable documents: bank statements, guaranteed investment certificates (where relevant), scholarship/loan letters, sponsor affidavits, or evidence of paid tuition. There is no single universal dollar amount; expectations depend on school tuition and living cost. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\n\nVisitor (B-1/B-2) / Short stays\n- The visitor visa requires showing purpose of visit (tourism, business), ties to home country, and sufficient funds for the stay. Strong evidence of intent to return (employment, property, family) helps but is assessed case-by-case. See State Dept guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\n\nWHAT MATTERS / WHAT DOES NOT\n- Matters: valid job offer + LCA + degree (H-1B); acceptance + I-20 + proof of funds (F-1); clear purpose + funds + ties to home country (B-1/B-2). Decisions influenced by documentation quality, consistency, and officer discretion. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}\n- Typically NOT automatic disqualifiers: age alone (no public universal age limit), marital status, prior home-country income (except as proof of funds where required). These may be relevant only to the extent they affect credibility or financial sufficiency. ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR RAG CONTENT\n- Include short canonical sections: (1) H-1B — definition + evidence checklist; (2) F-1 — I-20 + funds checklist; (3) short stays — required docs list; (4) common interpretations (e.g., what proves “specialized education” or “sufficient funds”). - Use only explicit policy text and examples; avoid asserting a specific numeric threshold for “sufficient funds” unless quoting a school or program amount.

Overview\n\nThe H-1B visa requires the employer to:\n\n* Offer a **specialty occupation** job. * Pay at least the **prevailing wage**. * Ensure the beneficiary meets all **qualification criteria**. This document provides general rules used by USCIS and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). It does **not** contain exact wage numbers (because they vary by location and change yearly). ---\n\n## 2. What Counts as a Specialty Occupation\n\nA job qualifies as a specialty occupation if **any** of the following are true:\n\n1. **A bachelor’s degree or higher (or equivalent experience) is normally the minimum requirement** for the occupation. 2. The degree requirement is **common within the industry** for similar positions. 3. The employer normally requires a degree for that role. 4. The specific duties are so specialized and complex that a bachelor’s degree is required. ### Common Specialty Occupation Fields\n\nThese commonly qualify:\n\n* Software Engineer, Developer, Programmer\n* IT Analyst, Systems Analyst\n* Data Scientist, ML/AI roles\n* Electrical/Mechanical/Computer Engineer\n* Accountants (with specific criteria)\n* Financial analysts\n* Architects\n* Medical professionals\n* University-level researchers\n* Specialty managers (if degree-related)\n\n### Minimum Educational Requirement\n\n* U.S. **Bachelor’s degree** or foreign **equivalent** (evaluated). * Or **12 years of experience** = equivalent to bachelor’s (3 years = 1 year of degree)\n* Degree must be **directly related** to the job field. ---\n\n## 3. SOC Codes Commonly Used\n\nSoftware-related occupations typically fall under:\n\n* **15-1252 Software Developers**\n* **15-1256 Software QA/Testers**\n* **15-1211 Computer Systems Analysts**\n* **15-1221 Data Scientists**\n\nThese SOC codes determine prevailing wage levels. ---\n\n## 4. Prevailing Wage Requirement (General Rules)\n\n### The employer must pay **the higher of**:\n\n* The **actual wage** paid to similar employees at the company, OR\n* The **prevailing wage** determined by DOL for that **occupation + location + level**. ### Factors that affect prevailing wage:\n\n1. **Job location (city/county/MSA)**\n\n * Large tech hubs have higher wages. 2. **Wage Level (1–4)** based on:\n\n * Required experience\n * Job complexity\n * Level of supervision\n3. **SOC code**\n\n### General Wage Level Meaning (Conceptual Only)\n\n* **Level 1 (Entry)** – Basic tasks, close supervision. * **Level 2 (Qualified)** – Moderate experience. * **Level 3 (Experienced)** – Advanced duties. * **Level 4 (Expert)** – Complex, leadership-level. ---\n\n## 5. General Salary Expectations (Safe, Non-Numeric Range Explanation)\n\nTo avoid hallucinating any specific wage values, the following are **accurate generalizations**:\n\n* In **high-cost cities** (e.g., San Francisco, NYC, Seattle), prevailing wages for software roles are **significantly higher** than in mid-cost areas. * In **mid-cost cities** (Austin, Denver, Atlanta), Level-1 wages for software roles are **moderate** and can be met by many early-career salaries. * In **low-cost areas**, Level-1 wages are **lower**, and even lower salaries may suffice. ### Key point for your chatbot:\n\n**A salary cannot be evaluated without the location AND job level. **\n\n---\n\n## 6. How USCIS Evaluates Salary Eligibility\n\nUSCIS examines:\n\n1. Employee’s job duties\n2.",
  "290": "SOC code assignment\n3. Job location\n4. Selected wage level (1–4)\n5. Offered salary\n\nIf the offered salary is **lower than the prevailing wage**, the petition is usually denied or requires correction. ---\n\n## 7. Required Information to Determine if Salary Is Enough\n\nFor ANY salary-eligibility question, the assistant must ask or check:\n\n### Mandatory:\n\n* **Job location (city/state)**\n* **Job title**\n* **Job duties (brief)**\n* **Experience required**\n* **Degree field**\n* **Salary offered**\n\n## 1. Why Salary Matters for H-1B\n\nFor H-1B visas, the employer must pay at least the **“actual wage”** or the **“prevailing wage”**, whichever is higher. * Actual wage: what current employees in similar positions earn at the same employer. * Prevailing wage: set by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) based on job location, SOC code, experience level (Level 1–4). Because prevailing wages vary significantly by geography, industry, and job level, there is **no fixed universal wage threshold**. Instead we can reason using **salary bands**. ---\n\n## 2. Salary Band Guidelines (for Software / Engineering / Common Tech Jobs)\n\nThese bands are approximate, meant to help eligibility reasoning. They are not legal thresholds. | **Band** | **Approx Annual Salary (USD, before tax)** | **Likely Corresponding Settings** |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Low Band** | ≈ 70,000 – 90,000 | Entry-level Software Engineer/Developer in low-to-mid cost regions; Level-1–2 wage levels. |\n| **Mid Band** | ≈ 90,000 – 120,000 | Junior-to-mid-level roles in mid-cost metro areas; Level-2 or low Level-3. |\n| **Upper-Mid Band** | ≈ 120,000 – 150,000 | Mid-to-senior roles in moderately expensive cities; Level-3 wage level. |\n| **High Band** | ≈ 150,000 – 200,000 | Senior / specialized roles, in high-cost metro areas (e.g., coastal tech hubs), Level-3/4. |\n| **Top Band** | > 200,000 | Senior/lead/architect/manager roles in high-cost metro regions or high-demand specialties; Level-4. |\n\n> **Important caveats:**\n>\n> * These bands are **guidelines**, not legal minima. > * Final wage eligibility depends on **job location, SOC code, required level, employer pay scales, benefits**. > * For low-band wages, acceptance depends on **low cost-of-living area** and verifying employer’s “actual wage.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. When Low or Mid-Band Might Be Accepted\n\nH-1B may still be approved at **low or mid-band** wages if:\n\n* Job location is in a **low or mid-cost area** (lower prevailing wage). * Role is **entry-level or junior** (Level 1 or 2). * Employer’s “actual wage” to similar staff is in that range (not just minimum). * The job duties match entry-level complexity (not senior/architect-level). * Employer provides proper documentation (LCA, wage attestation). In such cases, $75,000–85,000 in a small or mid-cost city could be valid; but in high-cost cities $100,000 might be borderline. ---\n\n## 4. When Wage Must Be Upper-Mid or Higher\n\nWage should be in **Upper-Mid / High / Top Band** if:\n\n* Job location is a **high-cost metro** (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles).",
  "291": "* Role demands **specialized or senior-level skills** (senior engineer, architect, management, specialized niche). * Experience level is high (senior, 5+ years). * Job responsibilities involve leadership, design, high responsibility, or niche domain expertise. In such cases, $120,000–150,000 may be considered entry-level for that region/role; lower might risk denial. ---\n\n## 5. Guidelines for Using Salary Bands in RAG / LLM Reasoning\n\nWhen a user asks: *“My salary offer is $X, am I eligible?”* — your assistant should:\n\n1. Ask: **“What is the job location (city/state)?”** — because prevailing wage depends strongly on location. 2. Ask: **“What is your job title & experience level (junior / mid / senior)?”** — determines the expected band. 3. Then compare X with **band ranges**, and respond with:\n\n * **Yes** (if X is comfortably within or above band for that location & level),\n * **Maybe / Borderline** (if X lies in lower band but location & level are low/entry),\n * **No** (if X is below band for given location & level or role is senior but wage is low). 4. Provide **explanation + caveats** (need employer’s actual wage report, SOC matching, and LCA approval). If user does not provide location or level, the bot should return **“Need more information (location + level of role)”** rather than giving a definitive yes/no. ---\n\n## 6. How to Incorporate in RAG Indexing\n\n* Save this document as **clean text** (not chunked) in your Data folder. * When you build embeddings, include it so RAG retrieval can fetch these guidelines. * In prompt builder, ensure that if user asks about salary → these lines are part of retrieved context. * This allows the LLM to make **evidence-based reasoning** rather than guesswork. ---\n\n## 7. Example Agent-style Answer Templates\n\n* **If user gives salary + location + role:**\n\n > “For a mid-cost city and junior Software Engineer role, your offered salary of US$85,000 falls in the lower end of acceptable band; assuming prevailing wage for that region is not significantly higher, this may be acceptable. You still need employer’s LCA/actual-wage attestation.”\n\n* **If user gives salary but no location/level:**\n\n > “I need to know the job’s location (city/state) and your level (junior, mid, senior) to check against prevailing wage bands. Please provide those details.”\n\n* **If user proposes senior role with low salary:**\n\n > “Your salary offer is below typical high-cost area senior-level ranges — this is unlikely to meet prevailing wage requirements. Consider negotiating higher pay or choosing a lower-cost region.”",

  "293": "Introduction\nAll individuals who apply at a Consulate or Embassy abroad for a United States entry or re-entry visa are\nscreened before the visa is issued, regardless of nationality. The U.S. has strict visa laws because it is an\nopen society. Unlike many other countries, the nation does not impose internal controls such as registration\nwith local authorities on its visitors. Yet, in order to enjoy the privilege of unencumbered travel in the U.S.,\ncertain requirements must be met. In particular, a foreign traveler has a responsibility to prove that he or she is going to return home from\ntravel abroad before a visitor visa will be issued. U.S. consular officers are required by law to view every\nvisa applicant as an intending immigrant until the applicant proves otherwise. Section 214(b) of the U.S.\nImmigration and Naturalization Act states: “Every alien shall presumed to be an immigrant until he\nestablishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is\nentitled to a nonimmigrant status.” Though the actual approval rate for first time visa applicants processed\nduring 2004 through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing remains near 70%, most of those visa applications that\nwere denied were refused under the terms of Section 214(b). More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 4\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n2 U.S. Visa Types for Business Travel\nThe United States issues two types of visas: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant. Within the nonimmigrant classification, multiple types of visa classes exist. “B” type visa referrals are\nappropriate for standardization experts from the People’s Republic of China who are invited to the U.S. to\nparticipate in either a meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO), or for those who are invited by U.S. firms as temporary visitors for\nbusiness. Visa Class – Type “B” Purpose of Travel\nB1 Temporary visitor for business\nB2 Temporary visitor for pleasure\nB1/B2 Temporary visitor for business or pleasure\n[NOTE: For a complete list of visa classes, please see Annex A of this document.] The B1 visa is intended for temporary business travel. This includes such travel as for the purpose of\nnegotiating contracts, attending exhibitions and conferences, short-term training, and consultations with\nsuppliers and customers. The B1 visa is not valid for employment in the U.S. The B2 visa is intended for tourist activities, such as sightseeing, visiting friends and relatives, obtaining\nmedical treatment, and attending non-vocational conferences and meetings. Visitors are not permitted to\naccept employment during their stay in the U.S. B2 visas are valid for one entry within three months of the\nissuance date. In some instances, a consular officer may elect to issue a B1 visa jointly with a B2 visa type. Generally, a\nB1/B2 visa means that while in the U.S. as a business visitor, an individual may attend meetings, and\nparticipate in them fully, conduct research, and engage in other business negotations.",
  "294": "Some B1/B2 visas are\nannotated to note a specific purpose of the trip to the U.S. NOTE: Effective January 15, 2005, qualifying Chinese nationals will receive B1 or B2 type visas that are\nvalid for twelve (12) months and multiple entries. The previous maximum validity for U.S. visas issued for\nthese purposes was only six months. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue visas reciprocally\nto U.S. citizens visiting China. This agreement is intended to help to ease the burden for businesses that\nhave Chinese clients and staff visiting their facilities on multiple occasions during the course of a year. More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 5\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n3 Applying for a B-Type Visa\nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Department of State introduced changes that have\nlengthened the visa application process. For example, in addition to the usual Nonimmigrant Visa\nApplication (form DS-156), all nonimmigrant visa applicants over the age of 16 must also complete and\nsubmit the Supplemental Nonimmigrant Visa Application (form DS-157). This form is required of all\napplicants, regardless of nationality and regardless of where the applicant applies. The consular post will conduct an initial review of the application and related documentation and clarify\nany outstanding questions during a subsequent interview.1 In general, an applicant must be able to\ndemonstrate his or her intention to enter the United States for a temporary period and solely for the purpose\nof tourism and/or short-term business. The applicant must also provide evidence of financial ability to\ncover his or her travel expenses to/from and stay in the United States. Finally, he or she must demonstrate\nsufficiently strong social, economic, and other ties to compel the applicant to return to China after the\ntemporary and lawful visit to the U.S. In addition to the documentation listed below, please be advised that, since March 2004, the U.S. Embassy\nin Beijing has been collecting biometric identifiers such as fingerprints from all nonimmigrant visa\napplicants. This is related to the U.S. implementation of requirements for machine-readable passports,\nnewer “biometric” passports that contain an identifying marker such as a fingerprint scan, and U.S. visas\nthat contain a biometric indicator. A massive new database, the US-VISIT entry and exit control system,\nhas also been introduced at major American border crossings. These measures help to increase the security\nof travel documents and help to ensure that the document holder is a legitimate traveler. 1\nA nonimmigrant visa applicant who has previously traveled to the U.S. using a B-type visa that (1) expired less than one year ago\nand (2) who is applying for the same type of visa, may drop his/her visa application and application fee receipt at a U.S. Consulate for\nadjudication. The consular officer reserves the right to require such applicants to appear for a subsequent interview if there are\nquestions unanswered by the application and supporting documentation.",
  "295": "More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 6\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n3.1 Documentation\nApplicants are encouraged to exercise care when completing the requested paperwork. Issues that may\ncause problems or delays in the visa application process include:\n(cid:131) The applicant has not spelled his/her name consistently on all documents (passport, visa application,\nsupporting documentation). This can cause delays and confusion. The name given on the visa\napplication and supporting documentation should be exactly the same as the name listed on the\npassport. (cid:131) The applicant has not read and followed the tips and guidance on the website of the U.S. consular post\nhaving jurisdiction over the visa application; this can cause delays or denial. (cid:131) The consular post cannot understand the kind of work the person is doing and officers cannot assess\nthe risk/benefit of granting the person a visa. A security clearance will likely be requested if the field is\nunclear. (cid:131) The applicant is from a country considered to pose a risk or is working in a field that is considered\n“sensitive” in some way, or if the Consular Lookout (CLASS) system turns up a “hit” on his/her name. The consular officers may tell the individual that a Security Advisory Opinion2 (SAO) is needed. The\nconsular post will send the applicant away telling him/her that the Security Advisory Opinion will take\nan undetermined period of time and he/she will be notified when it has been completed.

In January 2005, the State Department issued an updated Technology Alert List (TAL) to overseas consular officials on\nsensitive technology relating to the development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The previous TAL guide resulted\nin too many Chinese applicants being rejected even though their technology interests appeared to be of a non-sensitive nature.

All nonimmigrant\nvisa appointments will be made through the Visa Information Call Center. Services are offered in Mandarin, Cantonese, English, the Fuzhou dialect and the Taishan dialect. Pre-\nrecorded visa information is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Live operators are available from\n07:00 to 19:00, Monday through Friday and 08:00 to 17:00, Saturday. This is a user-pays service and the charge is 54 RMB (approximately US$7) for twelve (12) minutes or 36\nRMB (approximately US$4) for eight (8) minutes. Any unused minutes can be reused at a later time or\ntransferred to another party. Currently, there are three methods of payment: CITIC pre-paid PIN card,\ncredit or debit cards. NOTE: Some credit card users may need to first register with their bank for a program called “pay\ninternet” which enables credit card holders to make purchases over the phone. 3.2.2 Non-Appointment Interviews via the Beijing Business Visa Program\nThe productive relationships that many consular posts enjoy with local American Chambers of Commerce\n(AmCham) – and similar organizations – help to facilitate the full and timely attention given to visa\napplications submitted by legitimate foreign business travelers, especially those involved in trade,\nnegotiations and other dealings with U.S. companies. As an example, Beijing’s Business Visa Program has\nmore than 400 participating companies. Applicants from those companies can apply to a consular officer at\nthe U.S. Embassy in Beijing – without an appointment – any morning between 10:00 and noon, once the\nAmCham has notified the Embassy of the applicant’s intention to apply. More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 10\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n3.2.3 Non-Appointment Interviews via the Chengdu Expedited Visa Appointment Program\nIn anticipation of a growing need for business travel, the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu launched in December\n2004 a new Expedited Visa Appointment Program for business visa applicants from qualifying American\nChamber of Commerce company employees.",
  "298": "The program allows a visa applicant to come to the Chengdu\nConsulate without having to make an appointment through the China-wide call center. Interested companies are encouraged to contact the Sichuan American Chamber of Commerce directly\n(amcham@amcham-sichuan.org) to express interest in joining this program and to request an expedited\nappointment letter. With this letter, an applicant may appear at the Chengdu Consulate from 08:30 to 10:30\nor at 13:00 from Monday to Thursday for an appointment-free visa interview. All other requirements for an\napplication, fee receipt and supporting documents to indicate the purpose of the trip and strong ties to\nChina apply. Approved applicants will receive their visas after 16:00 the same day. Only direct employees of companies holding membership in the Sichuan AmCham and that have\nsignificant business interests in the U.S. may apply for a visa under the program (no distributors, customers,\nfamily members, etc. are allowed). More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 11\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n3.3 Applicant’s Interview with a Consular Officer\nApplicants are encouraged to arrive at the Embassy or Consulate well before the scheduled appointment\ntime. Business attire is recommended. For security reasons, cellular phones, cameras, beepers, briefcases,\nluggage and handbags will not be allowed during the interview, nor can anyone accompany an applicant to\nhis or her personal interview. During the interview the consular officer will question the applicant about his or her planned activity in the\nU.S. It is at this initial stage that clear and concise information about the purpose of the travel abroad\nshould be explained and any supporting documentation submitted for review by the consular officer. For example, delegates to an ISO or IEC technical committee or subcommittee meeting being hosted in the\nU.S. might wish to bring invitation letters, as well as copies of official meeting documents, such as calling\nnotices, meeting logistical information (venue, hotel information, etc.) and draft agendas to the interview. [NOTE: See Section 4 of this document for additional information.] Verbal answers must match the information in the invitation letter or any other supporting documentation\nthat had been presented to the consular officer. Problems arise if applicants mislead or appear to mislead\nthe interviewing officer as to their intent in visiting the U.S., which can happen when it appears they cannot\nanswer simple questions about their trips. Once it appears that a falsification has occured, the consular\nofficer will question other information supplied by the applicant. Throughout the interview, the applicant needs to keep in mind that, even more important than explaining\nwhy they have been invited to go to the United States, they need to persuasively demonstrate why it is they\nwill come back to China. This can be demonstrated by proving ties in China that would compel them to\nleave the U.S. at the end of the temporary stay.",
  "299": "This might include a high-status job and substantial\nincome; national prominence in their field; ownership of a house, apartment or a car; close family\nrelationships or dependents such as children or an elderly parent; a sizeable bank account, and so on. Well-\norganized documentation to prove such ties to China should be available and ready to present if requested\nby the consular officer. The interview will be short (typically one to three minutes in duration). Consular officers handle thousands\nof applications every year and are experienced in making swift decisions. They will quickly review the\napplication form(s) and supporting documents in order to narrow the range in which questions may need to\nbe asked. Much of the necessary information required to make a decision is already supplied on the\napplication form itself and in the invitation letter, so there is usually no need for the officer to ask more\nthan a few additional questions. More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 12\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\nWhile consular officers are trained to look at each application individually and consider professional, social,\ncultural and other factors, with younger applicants consular officers try to look at the applicant’s specific\nintentions, family situations and long-range plans and prospects within his or her country of residence. Especially with younger applicants, the reason for most refusals is not the documents but the applicant’s\ncurrent overall situation was not adequate to overcome the presumption that he or she is an intending\nimmigrant. NOTE: An applicant that has been previously denied may reapply for a nonimmigrant visa at any time. If\nnew information has become available which was not presented to the interviewing officer at the time of\nthe first application, or if the applicant’s overall circumstances have changed significantly since the last\napplication, a visa may be approved. 3.3.1 Submitting Personal Commentary on Visa Cases\nThree times per week, the visa section of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing opens its doors to American citizens\nfor the discussion of specific visa cases. Interested representatives must come prepared for the discussion\nby having the full name(s), passport number(s), and scheduled interview date(s) for each applicant. The open period operates on a first come-first served basis from 16:00 to 17:00 every Monday, Wednesday,\nand Friday. All American citizens present by 16:00 will have an opportunity to speak to an officer that\nday; anyone arriving after that will only be seen if time permits. Only American citizens are allowed to take\nadvantage of this opportunity, not citizens of any other countries or legal permanent residents of the U.S.\nAny U.S. organization wishing to comment on a specific visa application but that is unable to reach the\nEmbassy directly may send a communication via telefax (+86-10-6532-3178) to the Chief of the Visa\nSection, U.S. Embassy in Beijing. [NOTE: In January 2005, the Chief of the Visa Section is Mr.\nThurmond Borden.]",

The expiration date of the visa notes the last day a traveler may use\nthe visa to apply to enter the United States. The expiration date is not the last day the traveler is allowed to\nremain in the U.S.\nEvery time a traveler plans to travel to the U.S, he/she must assure that his or her passport is valid for at\nleast six months from the time he/she plans to depart the U.S. A traveler may travel with two passports –\none expired passport with a valid visa and a new passport.

An invitation letter written on behalf of an applicant can become an essential component of the package\nprovided by the applicant for review by the consular officer during the interview process. In all cases, the\nletter must be neat, accurate, and credible, and signed by a representative of the official host of the meeting\nthat is being held in the United States:\n(cid:131) For meetings of the IEC, a representative of the U.S. National Committee of the IEC (USNC/IEC) will\nprepare the invitation letter.",

The U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) has introduced some significant changes to\nhelp facilitate travel and make the visa process more transparent. For instance, interagency discussions\nrecently yielded a much-improved Visas Mantis SAO (Security Advisory Opinion) process; processing\ntimes have shortened considerably, and the process is more predictable. Also, the amount of visa data\npublished on State Department websites has been increased. In an October 20, 2004, memorandum from then-Secretary of State Colin Powell to Special Embassy Posts\non the subject of facilitating business travel, the former Secretary expressed his commitment to ensure that\nposts have the resources necessary to achieve his goal of “Secure Borders, Open Doors” and highlighted\nsome of the most common and effective facilitation initiatives in place worldwide:\nFormal Facilitation Programs\nMany posts have established formal facilitation programs that enroll major companies and permit their\nemployees to obtain expedited appointments, and/or expedited processing on the day of the interview. Typically, companies must meet strictly established criteria in order to be enrolled, and must adhere to\nstrict standards to stay in the program. Site visits are often critical to determine a company’s eligibility. While membership in these programs commonly is limited to companies that are members of host\ncountry’s American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), many posts enroll non-AmCham companies as\nwell. Variations of membership include only allowing participation by employees of companies that have\nbeen members of AmCham for at least one year, or limiting it to individuals applying for visas for business\npurposes, as opposed to those applying to visit the U.S. for tourism.",
  "302": "Common characteristics of formal\nprograms include:\n(cid:131) Collecting examples of each company’s letterhead and the signatures of authorized company\nrepresentatives for comparison purposes. Some posts make available to officers at their desktop an\nelectronic database of member companies’ profiles, including scanned images of its letterhead and\nsignatures. (cid:131) Allocating a specific number of visa appointments daily to businesspeople applying through the\nprogram. One mechanism to trigger expedited appointments is assigning companies specific codes, and\nrequiring applicants to indicate such codes when scheduling an appointment. Posts allowing walk-ins\nusually require applicants to present a letter issued by an authorized representative of their company. More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 18\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\nGroup Appointments\nMany posts expedite appointments for groups and/or schedule group appointments, and establish specific\ntime blocks when business groups may appear for interview. Time Block Set-Asides\nSpecific time blocks may be set aside weekly to allow certain categories of applicants to appear without an\ninterview. Categories may include all petition-based applicants, applicants with B visa referrals, individuals\ntraveling on U.S. Government (USG)-sponsored trips, government and military officials of a certain rank,\nand more. Business Facilitation Units\nMany posts assign specific officers and/or establish business facilitation units to serve as a point of contact\nfor the business community. This may include establishment of special e-mail addresses and/or phone\nnumbers to address questions from the business community and dispense information on the visa process. Training\nRegular business visa training for consular officers addresses a country’s economic conditions, provides\ninformation on the structure of the country’s business community, and discusses business-interviewing\ntechniques. The training usually is coordinated by the consular and economic or commercial sections, and\nmay also include representation from the front office and public diplomacy section. Recognizing that certain posts’ ability to facilitate business travel is impacted by larger foreign policy\nissues, all CA posts were encouraged to employ one or more of the initiatives described above while\nretaining the flexibility to accommodate urgent requests for appointments when appropriate.

In general, most Chinese companies will develop a visit plan for the next calendar year no later than\nDecember 31 of the preceeding year. An expert who wishes to attend a meeting or event abroad and travel\non a business passport should submit his or her request in the visit plan being considered by his or her\ncompany. The company’s visit plan will then be submitted to the relevant authority for consideration and\napproval. This authority might be a Ministry, City Government or Industry Association that has been\nauthorized by the Central government to conduct foreign affair matters. Upon approval of the company’s plan, this authority will be responsible for assisting individual applicants\nwith preparations for their visit(s) abroad.",
  "303": "This assistance will include an explanatory letter to the U.S.\nEmbassy that clearly indicates who will bear the traveler’s expenses while in the U.S., who is sending the\nexpert, who invited the expert and for what purpose. The competent authority will submit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the entire visa application package\n(as prepared by the traveler), including the other required documents described earlier in this text. The\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs will send all documents concerned to the U.S. Embassy and will advise the\nemployee of the interview date. If the visa application is approved, the Ministry will collect the approved\nvisa from the U.S. Embassy on behalf of the Chinese applicant. Experts who are interested in learning more about this procedure are encouraged to contact the relevant\ndepartment within their own company.

  "305": "Synopsis\nFor your B1/B2 tourist visa interview, bring your current passport (valid for 6 months), visa payment receipt, DS-160 confirmation page, and photos meeting US guidelines. It’s helpful to bring previous passports and relevant documents, such as proof of finances or business purpose. Keep personal items minimal, as large bags, electronics, and photography are not allowed at the consulate. Image for What documents to carry for a US visa interview?Agencies\nAt this stage of your B1/B2 tourist visa application process, you will have already completed your online visa application, submitted your biometrics, and scheduled your interview at the US embassy or consulate. Once your appointment is confirmed, it’s important to know exactly what documents to bring to your interview. Here's a detailed guide on the essential items you should prepare ahead of time. The specific documents required may vary depending on the type of visa you are applying for, but for a B1/B2 visa interview, the following are typically expected:\n\nYour current passport – Make sure it is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in the US. Printed visa application fee payment receipt – You should have a copy of the payment receipt for the visa application fee. Printed DS-160 confirmation page – A printed copy or screenshot of the confirmation page from your DS-160 form. Photographs – Bring copies of passport-style photographs that meet the US Visa photo guidelines. Additional guidelines\nPrevious Passports: While not officially required, it’s highly advisable to bring all your previous passports, including expired ones, to demonstrate proof of past travel. This can help strengthen your application. Photograph Guidelines: Make sure the photos you bring strictly adhere to the specific format and size requirements set by the US visa application process. It’s essential to follow these instructions carefully to avoid any issues with your application. Additional Documents: After scheduling your interview, you will receive detailed instructions from the embassy or consulate regarding the next steps. However, during your interview, the visa officer may ask you for additional documents that were not included in the original list. Don’t worry—you’ll be given an opportunity to submit these documents after the interview. The officer will provide you with a letter outlining what additional documents are needed and how to submit them. Interview Process: It’s important to remember that the US nonimmigrant visa application process is an interview-based process, not just a documentary process. The visa officer will want to hear directly from you, the applicant, regarding your qualifications for the visa. Expect questions about your previous international travel, current travel plans, and your professional and familial ties to your home country. While you don’t need to bring excessive documentation, it’s a good idea to have any relevant documents on hand—such as proof of financial stability or business-related documents—especially if your trip is work-related. Personal Items and Security: When attending your visa interview, it's best to bring as few personal items as possible.",
  "306": "There are no storage facilities available at the consulate, and items such as large bags, liquids, lighters, and matches are prohibited inside the consular building. You may bring a small document pouch to carry your passport, documents, and other necessities. However, please note that electronics such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and cameras are not allowed. Additionally, photographing the embassy or consulate premises, even from the outside, can result in your interview being postponed or canceled. By preparing these documents and following the guidelines carefully, you'll be ready for a smooth and efficient visa interview process. Family Immigration\nFamily Based Immigration\n\nA foreign citizen seeking to live permanently in the United States requires an immigrant visa (IV). To be eligible to apply for an IV, a foreign citizen must be sponsored by an immediate relative who is at least 21 years of age and is either a U.S. citizen or U.S. Lawful Permanent Resident (that is, a green-card holder). There are two types of family-based immigrant visas:\n\nImmediate Relative – these visas are based on a close family relationship with a U.S. citizen, such as a spouse, child or parent. The number of immigrants in these categories is not limited each fiscal year. Family Preference – these visas are for specific, more distant, family relationships with a U.S. citizen and some specified relationships with a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). The number of immigrants in these categories is limited each fiscal year. Keep in mind that U.S. citizens can file an immigrant visa petition for their:\n\n- Spouse\n- Son or daughter\n- Parent\n- Brother or sister\n\nU.S. Lawful Permanent Residents can only file an immigrant visa petition for their:\n\n- Spouse\n- Unmarried son or daughter",

  "337": "Nonimmigrant visa overview\nU.S. Visa - Directory of Visa Categories\nU.S. law provides for a wide variety of visas and classifications (“nonimmigrant visas”), all of which have particular requirements. Nonimmigrant visas are generally intended for short-term stays in the U.S. of a few months or years. An immigrant visa holder, on the other hand, is entitled to apply for entry to the U.S. as an immigrant, receives a Green Card after entry and can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely. Which nonimmigrant visa one qualifies for depends not only on one’s intended activities, but also on one’s nationality. For example, certain visas are only available to citizens of Chile, Singapore, Mexico or Canada. There are nonimmigrant visas for employees with a college education and employees with no education, visas for investors and entrepreneurs and visas for executives and managers. There are visas for renowned artists and athletes and special visas for entire sports teams and performers. And which visa is available to persons wanting to study in the U.S. depends on whether they intend to enroll in a full academic program of study, or participate in vocational trainings or courses. The following are the most important U.S. nonimmigrant visa categories:\n\nB-1 Visa (business visitors)\nE-1 Visa (treaty traders)\nE-2 Visa (treaty investors)\nH-1B Visa (temporary workers)\nH-2B Visa (temporary non-agricultural workers)\nI Visa (journalists, media representatives)\nJ Visa (trainees, au-pairs)\nK-1 Visa (fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens)\nK-3 Visa (spouses of U.S. citizens)\nL-1 Visa (intracompany transferees)\nO Visa (extraordinary ability - artists, athletes, scientists)\nP Visa (artists, athletes, entertainers, group performers)\nR Visa (religious workers)\nThe list above is not exhaustive.

Overview of nonimmigrant visa categories\nBelow you will find a longer list nonimmigrant visa categories for travel to the U.S. For each nonimmigrant visa type there are specific requirements that have to be fulfilled for the visa to be granted.

B-1 Visa – Temporary Business Visitor\nThe B-1 Visa (Temporary Business Visitor) is for individuals traveling to the U.S. to engage in business activities. Because the B-1 Visa is not an employment visa, work is not allowed. Individuals usually apply for a B-1 Visa when they cannot enter the U.S. under the visa waiver program (ESTA) because, for example, they wish to remain in the U.S. longer than 90 days or have a prior visa refusal or are otherwise disqualified from the ESTA-Program. B-1 visa – U.S. Visa for temporary business visitors\nAs is this case with most other nonimmigrant visas, the applicant must show that the purpose of his trip is consistent with the visa type, that he has no immigrant intent (i.e. that he has strong ties to a country outside the U.S. and will leave the U.S. at the end of his stay) and that he has or is receiving funds to cover the costs of his trip. Temporary stay in the U.S. The applicant must be able to show that he intends to stay in the U.S. temporarily. To show that his stay will be temporary, the applicant must present evidence that he has concrete plans and intentions related to actual business activities. An intent to depart is usually shown by presenting evidence of a permanent, full-time job, relevant business ties as well as social and family relationships outside the U.S.\n\nBusiness activities in the U.S. The business activities permitted when travelling on a B-1 Visa include, but are not limited to, attending meetings or conventions and negotiating contracts.",
  "339": "However, because work is prohibited, a B-1 Visa traveler should never receive any salary or compensation from a U.S. company or individual for activities performed in the U.S. Reimbursement for travel expenses, on the other hand, are generally permissible. It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation. Each applicant must apply for his or her own B-1 Visa and must meet the visa requirements independently.

E-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA\nE-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA - Visa Application Services\nIf you want to live in the USA for a longer period of time, a U.S. E visa is a good option. The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

Can I bring my family with me to the U.S. on an E-1 visa? Our worldwide advice on the E-1 treaty trader visa\nWhat type of commercial activity is required for an E-1 visa? An E-1 visa is only issued to self-employed persons or employees of U.S. companies who trade between the treaty country (e.g. Germany) and the USA. The term \"trade\" is to be understood relatively broadly in this context. It includes not only the exchange of goods but also the provision of services in the transport sector as well as in the banking and insurance industries and in the tourism industry. It is important to note that the exchange takes place directly between the USA and the contracting country. The trade must be of a certain size or substantial. The turnover amount plays a role that should not be underestimated here; however, the regularity and frequency of the exchange of goods or services over a longer period of time are more important. It is indispensable that the trade already exists. Anyone looking to first set up a business in the USA in order to then engage in trade must apply for the E-2 investor visa; the E-1 visa is not initially available in this case. What requirements do companies need to fulfil? In order to work on an E-1 treaty trader visa for a company located in the USA, that company must be at least 50 percent owned by natural persons of the other treaty country. Thus, an indispensable requirement is that the U.S. target company is at least 50 percent owned by German citizens if Germans are applying for the E-1 visa. If, for example, U.S. citizens also intend to operate within the company, a minimum of 50 percent German participation must be particularly heeded when founding the company. Caution is also advised when Germans who already hold a permanent residence permit for the USA (Green Card) are involved or intend to be involved. In the present context, they are not considered German citizens. Particularly in the case of larger companies, it is also important to note: If, in the course of time, the shareholder structure changes in such a way that the requirements related to nationality are no longer met, previously issued E visas will become invalid, even if the validity date printed on them is still current. Employees who are in the USA during the change of ownership would be considered illegal after the change is completed. These requirements also apply accordingly to cases from Austria, Switzerland or other states with which an E-1 agreement exists.

The application process for the E-1 treaty trader visa includes several forms to be completed and an application package to be assembled.

  "344": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions. Contents on this page:\n\nWhat qualifications do applicants need to have? What are the requirements for the workplace? What is the application process? What is the H-1B quota system? What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed.",
  "345": "Before the employer can file its petition for the applicant with the immigration authorities, they must file what is known as a Labor Condition Attestation (LCA) with the U.S. Department of Labor. This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter. The maximum stay may not exceed six years.",
  "346": "However, this maximum period of stay may not apply if an I-140 petition for a green card is pending. New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nIn a recent update in September 2025, President Donald Trump amended the H-1B visa fee structure, raising the cost of applying for an H-1B visa to USD 100,000. This fee increase, as outlined by the White House, is part of an ongoing effort to fund border security and reduce visa fraud. These changes will have a significant impact on employers and foreign workers, especially those in industries that rely on specialized talent from abroad. The most notable change is the substantial hike in the base filing fee for H-1B applications. Employers will now face a USD 100,000 fee to sponsor foreign workers; a sharp increase compared to previous years (USD 1,000). A portion of this fee will go toward funding fraud detection and border security efforts. Non-profit organizations and educational institutions may still be eligible for reduced fees, but for-profit businesses will be subject to the full USD 100,000 fee, which could influence their decision to sponsor H-1B workers. As these changes affect both employers and workers, it’s important to understand how the new fees impact your situation. WINHELLER can help you understand these updates and provide the guidance you need to manage the process effectively. Can I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Unlike many other visas, including the H-2B visa, the H-1B visa does not require the applicant to prove that he or she has no immigration intentions or that he or she will maintain a foreign residence. Accordingly, without this being a disadvantage to him or her as a matter of law, the applicant may file a green card petition while working in the U.S. on a H-1B visa. Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may apply for an H-4 visa to accompany the applicant. Albeit, they are not allowed to then work. There is, however, one important exception to this rule: If an I-140 petition has been approved for the H-1B visa holder, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for work authorization. H-2B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa\nThe H-2B visa category is intended for non-agricultural employees seeking to work in the U.S. temporarily. H-2B visa for German nationals\nSince December 18, 2012, only nationals of certain countries are eligible to apply for an H-2B visa. For a long time, German nationals were not eligible, unlike nationals from many other EU countries, including Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Spain. However, as of January 30, 2018, Germans nationals are eligible for an H-2B visa. Other nationals currently eligible for an H-2B visa are listed below.",
  "347": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications. In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years.",

How long is the L-1 visa valid? To open a new office, the L visa is valid for one year or residence in the USA is permitted for one year, after which it must be renewed. A stay of up to three years can be granted for renewals or for L visas applicable for collaboration with companies that are already in business. Renewals are possible for a two-year period. An L visa can be renewed a limited number of times. The holder of an L-1A visa (manager, executive) can thus work in the USA for a maximum of seven years; the holder of an L-1B visa (employee with specialized skills) can work for no more than five years. In this, it is not the possession of the visa for the specified period that counts but rather the physical stay in the USA. There may be exceptions for commuters who split their working time between the U.S. company and a group company outside the USA, i.e.",
  "349": "in which an extension beyond the five or seven years is possible. It should also be noted that the L visa is only valid together with a petition. It may well be that a visa is issued for five years but the petition is only valid for three years; in which case, the holder is only allowed to work in the USA for three years and would need to have the petition extended before the expiry date, but without having to apply for a new visa. What requirements must companies fulfil? 1. Relationship between the two companies involved\n\nThe first requirement is that the existing company in the home country and the company established in the USA or the office to be opened have a qualifying relationship with each other. Such a qualifying relationship exists, for example, when a dependent branch is established in the USA. However, it can also exist if both companies are legally independent. The decisive factor is then, above all, that one company has a stake in the other and that one company exercises de facto control over the other. However, a majority shareholding is not mandatory. Finally, a qualifying relationship for an L-1 visa also exists if both companies are owned and controlled by a third company or a natural person, for example, belonging to one and the same sole proprietor. The L-1 visa is therefore usually considered for parent, subsidiary or sister companies. 2. Ongoing business activities in Germany\n\nThe home company must maintain its business operations while the employee is in the USA. An L-1 visa is therefore not suitable for individual entrepreneurs whose business at home stands idle while they set up a new business in the USA. 3. Opening of a new office\n\nIn connection with the secondment of an employee to open a new office, it must be proven - namely, at the time of application - that sufficient office space has been rented. The visa is initially issued for only one year. What are the requirements for the L-1 visa applicant? The requirement for an L-1 visa is that the person to be transferred to the USA has either held a managerial position in the German company or has acquired and applied company-specific specialized knowledge. The position in the USA must also be a managerial position or require the application of specialized knowledge acquired abroad. However, the position in the USA and in Germany do not have to be the same. That is, someone with a managerial function in Germany could also be employed with specialized knowledge in the USA and vice versa. 1. Managerial position\n\nA person operates in a managerial position if he or she is responsible for the management of the company or one of its departments and supervises other employees in a senior position and has at least a say in the hiring and dismissal of other employees. 2.",
  "350": "Specialized knowledge\n\nSpecialized knowledge that also qualifies for an L-1 visa may, for example, relate to the product range or services offered by the company. However, an L-1 visa may also be considered for jobs that require intimate knowledge of internal company procedures. This is, nevertheless, vital in such cases in which the skills required for the position are not available on the U.S. labor market. 3. Duration of the activity and full-time employment\n\nLast but not least, it is required that the employee to be sent to the USA has been employed by the German company in a managerial position or with specialized knowledge for at least one year within three years prior to the application process. It should also be noted that only full-time employment can be considered and that part-time employment, even over several years, is not sufficient under any conditions. All requirements must be fulfilled when submitting the petition\nIt should be borne in mind that all the factual requirements that must be met for the petition to be approved must be in place at the time the petition is submitted. If documents, evidence or information are missing, the USCIS will usually request them (request for evidence), but no opportunities will be granted to first create the additional necessary conditions. For example, if the U.S. company is based in one U.S. state but the petitioner intends to do business in a different U.S. state, both the state permits must have been granted and an office must already have been leased when the petition is filed. If the applicant forgot to submit the tenancy agreement, this can usually be submitted at a later date. If, however, the applicant forgot to conclude such a contract, it is not helpful to quickly achieve this and send it after the petition has been received. An entirely new petition must be submitted. Blanket Petition - When the petition for an L-1 visa is not applicable\nThe application process for an L-1 visa is rather complex. The U.S. employer must file a petition with a wide variety of documentation with the U.S. immigration authorities (USCIS) in advance. Only after the petition has been approved can the employee then apply for the actual visa at the U.S. consulate. However, companies that meet some special requirements have the opportunity to apply for a so-called blanket petition. This makes it possible for the employees to be posted to actually only be required to attend the appointment at the U.S. consulate. Thus, it is no longer necessary to submit a petition in advance. Generally, only a U.S. company that has been in business for at least one year and meets one of the following requirements is eligible for a so-called blanket petition:\n\nAt least ten L-1 visas have been successfully applied for via the U.S. company (or U.S. group) in the past twelve months (namely, for managers, executives or so-called specialized knowledge professionals, whereby only members of certain occupational groups fall into the latter category, i.e.",
  "351": "specialized knowledge alone is not sufficient). The U.S. company or U.S.-based affiliated companies have annual sales of at least 25 million U.S. dollars. The U.S. company or group employs at least 1,000 workers in the USA. If such a blanket petition is approved by the USCIS for the first time, additional employees (managers, executives, specialized knowledge professionals) can be sent to the USA without first filing a petition. One consular appointment is sufficient. Family members and L-1 visa\nSpouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 can be issued an L-2 visa. However, only the spouse is permitted to work in the USA.

However, if a U.S. employer is not available, a U.S. agent must file the O-1 petition. The O visa includes three main sub-categories: the O-1A visa, the O-1B visa and the O-2 visa. The O-3 visa is for spouse and children of an O-1 or O-2 alien. O-1A visa\nAn O-1A visa is available to individuals who possess extraordinary ability in the field of sciences, arts, education, business or athletics; have received ongoing national or international recognition for their extraordinary ability; and intend to work in the U.S. temporarily in the same field. O-1B visa\nPersons who can demonstrate a record of extraordinary achievement in film or television production may qualify for an O-1B visa to work in the U.S. temporarily in the same field. O-2 visa\nPersons who are “essential” to an O-1 visa holder who is coming to the U.S. for an artistic or athletic performance (including a motion picture or television production) may be able to qualify for an O-2 visa to accompany the O-1 visa holder. What extraordinary skills are required?",
  "352": "The term \"extraordinary\" is interpreted differently depending on the field in which the applicant would like to work in the USA. A person looking to work in the field of the arts in the USA must demonstrate \"extraordinary abilities\" that differ from those of a person planning to work in science, education/training, business or sports. To work in the film and television industry, one must have rendered extraordinary achievements. Extraordinary skills in the arts\n\nIn order to demonstrate that an applicant has extraordinary abilities in the arts, the applicant must show that they have \"distinction.\" The term \"distinction\" is also used to describe a \"high level of achievement.\" Accordingly, a high degree of perfection is required. The applicant must clearly stand out from among their peers, e.g. as a leader in their field or at least widely known or for having a good reputation. Extraordinary skills in the fields of science, education/training, sports\n\nIn these areas, the applicant must show that he or she has extraordinary skills. This refers to a high level of expertise or competence that makes the applicant one of the best in their field. It must place them in the top few percent in their field. Extraordinary skills in the film and television industry\n\nAn applicant seeking to work in the film or television industry must demonstrate \"extraordinary achievement.\" The applicant must then show that they have been extraordinarily successful and reached a high level of accomplishment. The applicant must demonstrate above average achievements and be generally regarded as \"outstanding, notable or leading.\" As a rule, the requirements for actors are higher than for other O-1 aspirants. a) List of criteria for the fields of science, education, economics and sports:\nnationally or internationally recognized awards,\nmembership in associations open only to persons with unique abilities,\nemployment with such an association in an appropriate position,\nactivity as a juror in the relevant field,\npublications about the applicant in relevant professional journals and/or national newspapers,\npublications by the applicant in recognized journals,\nsignificant contributions in the relevant field (e.g. patents),\nan above-average salary or compensation. Please note that it is usually insufficient to, for example, submit a newspaper article or show proof of membership. The USCIS also generally requires evidence in connection with a criterion that the newspaper is national, how large the circulation is, among other things, in comparison to other newspapers or that, and to what extent, extraordinary skills are a prerequisite for membership and the like. b) List of criteria for the field of art:\nParticipation in a leadership position in productions or events that have an outstanding reputation,\nThe applicant has received international or national recognition for their achievements,\nThe applicant holds a leading or critical position in an organization with an outstanding reputation,\nCommercial success or critical acclaim,\nRecognition by relevant organizations, government agencies or experts,\nAn above-average salary or remuneration. Again, the point made above is that mere proof as such is, in most cases, insufficient for the petition.",
  "353": "How do I apply for an O visa for the USA? 1. U.S. Petitioner\nAs stated above, the participation of a U.S. petitioner is necessary for the process. A U.S. employer or a U.S. agent may act as such. The U.S. agent then represents the foreign employer and/or the applicant. If the petitioner has a U.S. employer, this employer may act as petitioner. As a rule, the employment contract must then be attached to the application. If the applicant does not have a U.S. employer but only one foreign employer, is self-employed, or would like to work for multiple U.S. employers (e.g. concert promoters for a musician, magazines for a fashion photographer), they will need the assistance of a U.S. agent or agency. In this case, the agent or agency files the petition on behalf of the applicant or employer(s). This requires various contractual documents (between the petitioner and the applicant, between the petitioner and the U.S. employers). In the case of multiple U.S. employers, each U.S. employer can also file a separate petition. However, this is not recommended due to reasons of cost and time. It shall be noted: A person (legal or natural) residing outside the United States cannot file a petition as an agent or employer. 2. Letter of recommendation\nAt the time of application, the submission of a letter of recommendation from a U.S. trade union or U.S. peer group (in the form of an advisory opinion, consultation letter or no-objection letter) providing commentary on the applicant's qualifications and the activity to be carried out in the USA is required. Unions or peer groups usually require the submission of the fully compiled petition in order to issue the letter or to be able to assess from their perspective whether the applicant has extraordinary abilities. However, the USCIS is not bound by its decision and assessment. 3. Activity at several locations\nIf the applicant intends to perform or work in more than one place, an itinerary showing the place and date of each activity must be attached to the application. What is the processing time for the O visa? The procedure for obtaining an O visa is essentially a two-stage process. The first step is to file the petition with the USCIS. Once the petition is approved, the second step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. Consulate. The USCIS may require several months to review the petition. By paying a fee currently in the amount of 2,500 USD, the processing time can, however, be reduced to 15 days. Nevertheless, in many cases, the USCIS does not respond with a final decision after the deadline but instead requests further evidence, documentation and information. Once the petition has been approved, the visa application is usually a mere formality. The applicant must complete an application form (purely electronic or online), pay the visa fee and must then make an appointment to appear in person at the U.S. Consulate.",
  "354": "Appointments are usually available within a few days or one to two weeks. As a rule, the Consulate does not review whether the specific requirements for the O visa have been met. Which visa must my accompanying personnel apply for? If an artist or athlete holds an O-1 visa, an O-2 visa may be issued for accompanying personnel if the accompanying person is indispensable to the O-1 visa holder's venture. Whether someone is indispensable depends on the visa holder's occupation, the O-2 applicant's skills and/or knowledge and cooperation prior to submitting the application. If the O-1 visa holder works in the fields of science, business, education/training, an O-2 visa cannot be issued. What type of visa applies to family members? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may accompany persons traveling to the United States on an O-1 or O-2 visa. However, they are not then allowed to work. They will receive a U.S. visa of the category O-3. How long is the O visa valid? The visa entitles the holder to enter the country ten days before the start of the activity or the date indicated on the application (more precisely: the approval notice) up to a U.S. stay ten days beyond the date indicated on the application. However, work is not allowed during these ten days. IMPORTANT: The visa does not determine how long the visa holder is allowed to work in the USA . The visa itself is often issued for a full five years. The visa is merely permission to travel to the U.S. and ask for entry. How long you are allowed to work is determined by the petition (i.e. approval notice) and the I-94 form. The petition must therefore be presented together with the visa at the time of entry. The (electronic) form will be issued by a border official upon entry. O visa or P visa - When do I apply for which visa? While the O visa is usually suitable for individuals (possibly together with accompanying support personnel) who would like to perform in the USA or work in a company, the P visa is more suitable for groups of artists or athletes (sports team, string quartet, etc.) who would like to perform in the USA. Additionally, for athletes who would like to compete in the USA and receive not only prize money but also other compensation from a U.S. source, the P visa is the more appropriate visa category.",
  "355": "U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING – DOCUMENT CHECKLIST AND GUIDANCE\n(2025)\nSource basis: This guide is based mainly on official U.S. government information about F‑1\nand M‑1 student visas from the U.S. Department of State (travel.state.gov), the Student and\nExchange Visitor Program (SEVP/SEVIS), and additional guidance from U.S. universities and\nconsular resources. It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening”\npurposes and is not legal advice. Always check the latest information from official U.S.\ngovernment websites and your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate before applying. ------------------------------------------------------------\n1. OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems\ncarry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1\nvisa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE DOCUMENTS FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Form DS‑160 – Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application\nEvery nonimmigrant visa applicant must complete Form DS‑160 online and submit it\nelectronically. The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history,\nfamily information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media\nidentifiers. Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years. Officers may review online content as part of security vetting.",
  "356": "A visa‑screening engine should cross‑check DS‑160 data with other documents and flag any\ninconsistencies (for example, different dates of birth, different spellings of the school name,\nor undeclared previous refusals). 2.2 Valid passport\nApplicants must hold a passport that:\n- Is valid for at least six months beyond the intended date of entry to the U.S. (unless\nexempted by a specific agreement between the U.S. and the applicant’s country). - Shows the correct spelling of the applicant’s name in Roman letters. - Has at least one or two blank pages for the visa foil and entry stamps. For screening, verify that the passport is not expired, not damaged, and matches the identity\ndetails on DS‑160 and SEVIS. 2.3 Form I‑20 (for F‑1/M‑1) or DS‑2019 (for J‑1)\nForm I‑20 is issued by a Student and Exchange Visitor Program–approved school for F‑1 or\nM‑1 students. It contains:\n- Student’s name, date of birth, SEVIS ID number. - School information and school code. - Program start and end dates. - Program level and field of study. - Tuition fees and estimated living expenses. - Details of any scholarships or school financial support. Key screening checks for I‑20:\n- SEVIS ID on the I‑20 matches the DS‑160 and the SEVIS payment receipt. - Program start date is in the future, and the visa is requested within the allowed time\nwindow (you can generally apply up to 365 days before the program start, but you may\nenter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before that date). - The program is full‑time and at an appropriate educational level. - The financial information on the I‑20 (costs and funding sources) is consistent with the\nfinancial documents submitted. For J‑1 programs, DS‑2019 plays a similar role, listing program sponsor, category, and\nfunding information. 2.4 SEVIS I‑901 fee payment receipt\nBefore a visa interview, most F‑1, M‑1 and J‑1 applicants must pay the SEVIS I‑901 fee and\nprint the payment confirmation receipt. This fee supports the Student and Exchange Visitor\nInformation System used to track students and exchange visitors in the U.S. Screening points:\n- SEVIS ID on the receipt must match the SEVIS ID on Form I‑20/DS‑2019. - The payment date should be before the interview. - If a student changes school and receives a new I‑20 with a new SEVIS ID, a new SEVIS fee\nmay be required unless the rules allow a transfer of the previous fee. ------------------------------------------------------------\n3. INTERVIEW APPOINTMENT, PHOTO AND MRV FEE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n3.1 Visa application (MRV) fee payment\nMost applicants pay a Machine‑Readable Visa (MRV) fee before scheduling the interview. Procedures vary by country but usually involve creating an online profile, paying the fee,\nand then selecting an appointment slot. Screening system tasks:\n- Record the MRV payment confirmation number and date. - Check that the barcode number on the appointment confirmation matches the DS‑160 and\nprofile. 3.2 Digital photo\nU.S. visa photos must follow strict rules for size, background, face position, and recency.",
  "357": "Often the photo is uploaded as part of the DS‑160, and sometimes you must bring a printed\ncopy to the interview. A screening engine can check that:\n- A photo was successfully uploaded. - The photo meets basic specifications (for example, square aspect ratio, no heavy editing). - The same photo (or a recent one) appears in the application profile to reduce identity risk. 3.3 Appointment confirmation\nApplicants must bring the interview appointment confirmation page. While this is not a\n“screening” document for immigration rules, missing it can prevent access to the consulate. A comprehensive system may still track it so that checklists shown to students are\ncomplete. ------------------------------------------------------------\n4. FINANCIAL EVIDENCE FOR STUDY IN THE U.S.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA major part of U.S. student visa screening is verifying that the applicant can afford their\neducation without working illegally or relying on public funds. 4.1 How much funding is required? The minimum funding is usually based on the school’s estimate of:\n- Tuition and required fees for one academic year (or the whole program if shorter), and\n- Estimated living expenses (housing, food, insurance, books, etc.) for 9–12 months. These estimates appear on the I‑20 or DS‑2019. Some consulates also publish rough funding\nguidelines. Students must show they have enough money from acceptable sources to cover\nthese costs for at least the first year, and often must indicate a plausible plan for the entire\nprogram duration. 4.2 Types of acceptable financial documents\nCommon evidence includes:\n- Bank statements or bank letters for personal savings accounts. - Fixed deposits or certificates of deposit that can be liquidated. - Scholarship letters from the school or external sponsors. - Approved educational loan letters. - Evidence of sponsor income such as salary slips, tax returns, or business registration if the\nfunds come from parents or relatives. The screening system should verify that:\n- The documents clearly show the account holder’s name, institution name, account\nnumber, and currency. - Balances are sufficient to meet or exceed the required amount when converted to U.S.\ndollars using an appropriate rate. - Funds appear stable and legitimately obtained rather than sudden unexplained large\ndeposits immediately before the visa interview. - If multiple sponsors are used, the combined funding still meets the requirement and each\nsponsor’s relationship to the student is documented. 4.3 Sponsor relationship and intent\nIn many countries, parents or close relatives act as financial sponsors. Officers will look for:\n- Proof of relationship (birth certificates, family registers, etc., if requested). - A reasonable link between the sponsor’s income and the promised funding. - A logical explanation of why the sponsor is willing and able to support the student. For visa‑screening logic, flags should appear when income seems inconsistent with savings,\nor when the sponsor is a distant acquaintance with no clear reason to provide large sums. 4.4 Common financial refusal patterns\nTypical reasons for denial related to finance include:\n- Insufficient funds to cover tuition plus living costs.",
  "358": "- Use of documents from unregulated banks or unverifiable financial institutions. - Over‑reliance on funds that are not easily accessible (for example, property valuations\nwithout a loan or sale). - Financial stories that conflict with the student’s stated background or DS‑160 answers. ------------------------------------------------------------\n5. ACADEMIC, ENGLISH AND STUDY‑PLAN EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n5.1 Admission letter and academic documents\nAlthough the primary official record of admission is the I‑20 or DS‑2019, students usually\nbring:\n- University admission or offer letter. - Academic transcripts and diplomas (school, college, previous university). - Standardized test scores (such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT) if required by\nthe school. These documents help show that the student is academically prepared. Screening checks:\n- The course details in the admission letter are consistent with the I‑20 (program name,\nlevel, start date). - Academic history in DS‑160 matches the transcripts and qualifications supplied. - Any gaps in education or work history are explained. 5.2 English‑language ability\nFor most academic programs, U.S. schools set minimum English‑language requirements. The consular officer may also informally evaluate English during the interview. Poor\nlanguage ability may raise doubts about whether the student can follow the course and\nwhether the offer of admission is genuine. A screening engine can:\n- Record test names, scores, and test dates. - Compare scores with program requirements. - Flag missing or expired English‑language evidence for schools that normally require it. 5.3 Study plans and career goals\nDuring the interview, officers often ask why the applicant chose that particular course,\nuniversity and country, and how the education fits into their long‑term plans. There is no\nseparate document for this, but consistency between the personal statement provided to\nthe university, DS‑160 answers, and interview responses is crucial. From a visa‑screening perspective, large mismatches (for example, weak academic history\nbut very expensive, unrelated course with vague career plan) may signal higher refusal risk. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6. NONIMMIGRANT INTENT AND TIES TO HOME COUNTRY (INA 214(b))\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, most nonimmigrant visa\napplicants are presumed to be intending immigrants unless they can convince the officer\nthat they will respect the terms of their visa and leave the U.S. or change status lawfully at\nthe end of their permitted stay. For students, this means demonstrating both:\n- A credible plan to study full‑time and follow status rules; and\n- Strong connections (“ties”) outside the U.S. that make it likely they will leave after study,\nsuch as family responsibilities, career prospects, property, or business. 6.1 Typical “ties” evidence\nApplicants may bring informal supporting documents such as:\n- Evidence of family living in the home country (family registers, residence documents). - Proof of owned property or long‑term tenancy. - Letters from employers noting future job opportunities after graduation. - Business registration certificates or partnership documents. - Previous international travel history showing they respected visa rules in other countries. These documents are not always requested, but they can help in borderline cases.",
  "359": "A\ndecision‑support system could store such evidence metadata and mark applications where\nties appear weak, which may require extra preparation for the interview. 6.2 Common 214(b) refusal patterns\nFrequent reasons for refusal under 214(b) include:\n- Inability to explain why the chosen course and university make sense for the applicant’s\nbackground. - Very weak career plans or unrealistic expectations about working long‑term in the U.S. on\na temporary student visa. - Inadequate financial situation combined with an expensive course. - Major inconsistencies between DS‑160, documents and interview answers. - Lack of clear connections to the home country or evidence of plans to remain in the U.S.\npermanently without an immigrant visa route. ------------------------------------------------------------\n7. SECURITY, PUBLIC‑SAFETY AND PUBLIC‑HEALTH SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\n7.1 Security and criminality checks\nInformation from the DS‑160, biometrics appointment and other databases is used to run\nchecks for criminal records, terrorism links, previous immigration violations, and other\nsecurity concerns. Officers and automated systems look for:\n- Past arrests or convictions, especially for serious offences. - History of overstaying visas or working without authorization. - Inconsistencies in identity information that suggest fraud. Most of these checks use government databases and are not visible to the applicant. However, a visa‑screening tool for training purposes can simulate this by including\nquestions about previous refusals, travel history and any legal incidents. 7.2 Social‑media and digital‑footprint review\nRecent policy requires applicants to list social‑media handles. Consular posts may review\npublic social‑media content for signs of:\n- Support for violence or terrorism. - Clear fraud (for example, posts contradicting stated employment or study plans). - Involvement in scams or visa‑selling schemes. Students should assume that anything they post publicly could be considered, and a\nscreening checklist can remind them to ensure their online presence matches the story in\ntheir application. 7.3 Medical and vaccination issues\nMost student visa applicants do not need a full immigrant‑style medical exam, but they must\ntruthfully answer DS‑160 questions on communicable diseases, harmful behaviour and\ndrug use. Later, when applying for student health insurance or when entering the U.S., they\nmay need to show vaccination records or undergo health checks required by the school. ------------------------------------------------------------\n8. BIOMETRICS, INTERVIEW AND PORT‑OF‑ENTRY SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\n8.1 Biometrics collection\nMany countries now use a two‑step process:\n- Biometrics appointment at a visa application center, where fingerprints and a digital\nphotograph are captured. - Visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Biometrics link the applicant’s identity to their DS‑160 data and enable checks against U.S.\nand international databases. A screening system should confirm that the biometrics\nappointment is scheduled/completed before the interview date. 8.2 Visa interview\nThe visa interview is the core of the screening process. The officer has access to:\n- DS‑160 responses. - SEVIS data and I‑20 information. - Previous U.S. visas and travel history. - Security and risk‑assessment tools. During the interview, the officer may ask questions about:\n- The chosen program and university. - Funding sources and how the family earns money.",
  "360": "- Ties to the home country and future plans. - Previous travel and visa history. - Any unusual items in the DS‑160 or documents. For a training or RAG‑based screening system, sample interview questions and ideal answer\npatterns can be added as separate knowledge chunks linked to specific risk factors (for\nexample, low grades, late program changes, or large unexplained deposits). 8.3 Admission at the U.S. port of entry\nEven with a valid visa, a student is separately screened by Customs and Border Protection\n(CBP) when they arrive in the U.S. They must carry:\n- Passport with valid student visa. - Original Form I‑20 or DS‑2019 signed by the school. - SEVIS fee payment proof. - School contact information and financial evidence, in case CBP asks to see it. CBP officers decide whether to admit the student and for how long (recorded electronically\nas the I‑94 admission record). A thorough visa‑screening training tool should cover this\nfinal step and remind students that they must obey CBP’s instructions and verify their I‑94\ndetails online after entry. ------------------------------------------------------------\n9. HIGH‑LEVEL CHECKLIST FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING SYSTEM\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following checklist summarises the main items a visa‑screening or advisory system\nshould verify. Each point can be turned into a yes/no rule, flag, or question to the user. A. Identity and core records\n1. Passport valid at least six months beyond intended entry. 2. DS‑160 completed and submitted; confirmation page generated. 3. Personal details consistent across passport, DS‑160, I‑20/DS‑2019 and school\nrecords. 4. SEVIS record active and SEVIS ID consistent across all documents. 5. SEVIS I‑901 fee paid; receipt linked to correct SEVIS ID. B. Course and admission\n6. Applicant holds a valid I‑20 (or DS‑2019) from a SEVP‑approved institution. 7. Program is full‑time and appropriate for the student’s academic background. 8. Program start date, level, and major make sense and match admission letter. 9. Standardised tests and academic history support the likelihood of success. C. Financial sufficiency\n10. School’s estimated annual cost recorded from I‑20. 11. Sufficient liquid funds shown to cover tuition and living costs for at least one year. 12. Financial documents are recent, verifiable, and logically connected to the sponsors. 13. Educational loans, if used, are approved in writing by a recognised lender. 14. Funding plan for the remaining years (if the degree is longer) is plausible. D. Nonimmigrant intent and ties\n15. DS‑160 answers and interview preparation show clear plans to return or change status\nlawfully. 16. Evidence of ties (family, property, career prospects, business) is gathered where\nappropriate. 17. No major contradictions suggesting the applicant’s real goal is long‑term work or\nimmigration via a temporary student visa alone. E. Security and compliance\n18. DS‑160 security questions answered; no undisclosed arrests, convictions, or\nimmigration violations. 19. Social‑media identifiers provided; online activity does not obviously conflict with stated\nintentions. 20. Biometrics collected successfully and matched with identity records. 21. No hits in security databases that would require mandatory refusal without a waiver. F. Process completion\n22.",
  "361": "MRV fee paid; interview scheduled and appointment confirmation available. 23. Required supporting documents selected according to local embassy/consulate\nchecklist. 24. Applicant understands student‑status responsibilities after arrival (full‑time study,\nreporting address changes, employment limits, etc.). 25. Port‑of‑entry requirements explained: carry passport, visa, I‑20/DS‑2019, SEVIS receipt\nand school contact details. ------------------------------------------------------------\n10. CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES FOR U.S. VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe U.S. student visa system is structured around three big questions:\n1. Are you a genuine student? 2. Can you afford to study without breaking the rules? 3. Will you respect the terms of the visa and U.S. law? Most document requirements and interview questions connect back to these three ideas. Many refusals happen not because a student is ineligible, but because the application file is\nincomplete, inconsistent, or poorly explained. A well‑designed U.S. visa‑screening tool or RAG‑based assistant should therefore:\n- Collect all core documents in a structured way (passport, DS‑160 details, I‑20, SEVIS\nreceipt, financial evidence, academic records). - Automatically cross‑check names, dates, and key numbers to catch mistakes early. - Calculate approximate minimum funding requirements and compare them against\nuploaded financial documents. - Ask dynamic follow‑up questions based on risk indicators (large recent deposits, frequent\nprevious refusals, weak explanation of course choice). - Provide customised checklists based on the country of application, visa category\n(F‑1/M‑1/J‑1), and presence of dependants. - Offer practice interview prompts and feedback that help applicants give clear, truthful,\nand concise answers. - Emphasise honesty and consistency across all stages: university application, DS‑160,\ninterview, and arrival at the port of entry. For real applications, students must always follow the latest instructions from\ntravel.state.gov, the SEVP/SEVIS program, and their local U.S. embassy or consulate. However, this “U.S. Visa Screening” document offers a detailed conceptual map of the F‑1\nstudent visa screening process and can be stored as a rich knowledge source within your\nvisa‑assistant system."
