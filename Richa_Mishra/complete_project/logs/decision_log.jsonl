How long is the L-1 visa valid? To open a new office, the L visa is valid for one year or residence in the USA is permitted for one year, after which it must be renewed. A stay of up to three years can be granted for renewals or for L visas applicable for collaboration with companies that are already in business. Renewals are possible for a two-year period. An L visa can be renewed a limited number of times. The holder of an L-1A visa (manager, executive) can thus work in the USA for a maximum of seven years; the holder of an L-1B visa (employee with specialized skills) can work for no more than five years. In this, it is not the possession of the visa for the specified period that counts but rather the physical stay in the USA.

However, an L-1 visa may also be considered for jobs that require intimate knowledge of internal company procedures. This is, nevertheless, vital in such cases in which the skills required for the position are not available on the U.S. labor market. 3. Duration of the activity and full-time employment\n\nLast but not least, it is required that the employee to be sent to the USA has been employed by the German company in a managerial position or with specialized knowledge for at least one year within three years prior to the application process. It should also be noted that only full-time employment can be considered and that part-time employment, even over several years, is not sufficient under any conditions. All requirements must be fulfilled when submitting the petition\nIt should be borne in mind that all the factual requirements that must be met for the petition to be approved must be in place at the time the petition is submitted. If documents, evidence or information are missing, the USCIS will usually request them (request for evidence), but no opportunities will be granted to first create the additional necessary conditions. For example, if the U.S. company is based in one U.S. state but the petitioner intends to do business in a different U.S. state, both the state permits must have been granted and an office must already have been leased when the petition is filed. If the applicant forgot to submit the tenancy agreement, this can usually be submitted at a later date. If, however, the applicant forgot to conclude such a contract, it is not helpful to quickly achieve this and send it after the petition has been received. An entirely new petition must be submitted. Blanket Petition - When the petition for an L-1 visa is not applicable\nThe application process for an L-1 visa is rather complex. The U.S. employer must file a petition with a wide variety of documentation with the U.S. immigration authorities (USCIS) in advance. Only after the petition has been approved can the employee then apply for the actual visa at the U.S. consulate. However, companies that meet some special requirements have the opportunity to apply for a so-called blanket petition. This makes it possible for the employees to be posted to actually only be required to attend the appointment at the U.S. consulate. Thus, it is no longer necessary to submit a petition in advance. Generally, only a U.S. company that has been in business for at least one year and meets one of the following requirements is eligible for a so-called blanket petition:\n\nAt least ten L-1 visas have been successfully applied for via the U.S. company (or U.S. group) in the past twelve months (namely, for managers, executives or so-called specialized knowledge professionals, whereby only members of certain occupational groups fall into the latter category, i.e."}, {"uid": "313", "score": 0.5673401951789856, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 313}, "text": "in which an extension beyond the five or seven years is possible. It should also be noted that the L visa is only valid together with a petition. It may well be that a visa is issued for five years but the petition is only valid for three years; in which case, the holder is only allowed to work in the USA for three years and would need to have the petition extended before the expiry date, but without having to apply for a new visa. What requirements must companies fulfil? 1. Relationship between the two companies involved\n\nThe first requirement is that the existing company in the home country and the company established in the USA or the office to be opened have a qualifying relationship with each other. Such a qualifying relationship exists, for example, when a dependent branch is established in the USA. However, it can also exist if both companies are legally independent. The decisive factor is then, above all, that one company has a stake in the other and that one company exercises de facto control over the other. However, a majority shareholding is not mandatory. Finally, a qualifying relationship for an L-1 visa also exists if both companies are owned and controlled by a third company or a natural person, for example, belonging to one and the same sole proprietor. The L-1 visa is therefore usually considered for parent, subsidiary or sister companies. 2. Ongoing business activities in Germany\n\nThe home company must maintain its business operations while the employee is in the USA. An L-1 visa is therefore not suitable for individual entrepreneurs whose business at home stands idle while they set up a new business in the USA. 3. Opening of a new office\n\nIn connection with the secondment of an employee to open a new office, it must be proven - namely, at the time of application - that sufficient office space has been rented. The visa is initially issued for only one year. What are the requirements for the L-1 visa applicant? The requirement for an L-1 visa is that the person to be transferred to the USA has either held a managerial position in the German company or has acquired and applied company-specific specialized knowledge. The position in the USA must also be a managerial position or require the application of specialized knowledge acquired abroad. However, the position in the USA and in Germany do not have to be the same. That is, someone with a managerial function in Germany could also be employed with specialized knowledge in the USA and vice versa. 1. Managerial position\n\nA person operates in a managerial position if he or she is responsible for the management of the company or one of its departments and supervises other employees in a senior position and has at least a say in the hiring and dismissal of other employees. 2."}, {"uid": "292", "score": 0.5639815330505371, "meta": {"source": "US_7.pdf", "chunk_id": 292}, "text": "Most visa applicants, except H-1B and L, need to show their\nintent to return to their home country after their temporary\nstay in the United States.

The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered.

Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree.

How long is the L-1 visa valid? To open a new office, the L visa is valid for one year or residence in the USA is permitted for one year, after which it must be renewed. A stay of up to three years can be granted for renewals or for L visas applicable for collaboration with companies that are already in business. Renewals are possible for a two-year period. An L visa can be renewed a limited number of times. The holder of an L-1A visa (manager, executive) can thus work in the USA for a maximum of seven years; the holder of an L-1B visa (employee with specialized skills) can work for no more than five years. In this, it is not the possession of the visa for the specified period that counts but rather the physical stay in the USA. There may be exceptions for commuters who split their working time between the U.S. company and a group company outside the USA, i.e."}, {"uid": "313", "score": 0.5355216264724731, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 313}, "text": "in which an extension beyond the five or seven years is possible. It should also be noted that the L visa is only valid together with a petition. It may well be that a visa is issued for five years but the petition is only valid for three years; in which case, the holder is only allowed to work in the USA for three years and would need to have the petition extended before the expiry date, but without having to apply for a new visa. What requirements must companies fulfil? 1. Relationship between the two companies involved\n\nThe first requirement is that the existing company in the home country and the company established in the USA or the office to be opened have a qualifying relationship with each other. Such a qualifying relationship exists, for example, when a dependent branch is established in the USA. However, it can also exist if both companies are legally independent. The decisive factor is then, above all, that one company has a stake in the other and that one company exercises de facto control over the other. However, a majority shareholding is not mandatory. Finally, a qualifying relationship for an L-1 visa also exists if both companies are owned and controlled by a third company or a natural person, for example, belonging to one and the same sole proprietor. The L-1 visa is therefore usually considered for parent, subsidiary or sister companies. 2. Ongoing business activities in Germany\n\nThe home company must maintain its business operations while the employee is in the USA. An L-1 visa is therefore not suitable for individual entrepreneurs whose business at home stands idle while they set up a new business in the USA. 3. Opening of a new office\n\nIn connection with the secondment of an employee to open a new office, it must be proven - namely, at the time of application - that sufficient office space has been rented. The visa is initially issued for only one year. What are the requirements for the L-1 visa applicant? The requirement for an L-1 visa is that the person to be transferred to the USA has either held a managerial position in the German company or has acquired and applied company-specific specialized knowledge. The position in the USA must also be a managerial position or require the application of specialized knowledge acquired abroad. However, the position in the USA and in Germany do not have to be the same. That is, someone with a managerial function in Germany could also be employed with specialized knowledge in the USA and vice versa. 1. Managerial position\n\nA person operates in a managerial position if he or she is responsible for the management of the company or one of its departments and supervises other employees in a senior position and has at least a say in the hiring and dismissal of other employees. 2."}, {"uid": "272", "score": 0.5012123584747314, "meta": {"source": "US_3.pdf", "chunk_id": 272}, "text": "family members\nG-5 Attendants, servants and personal employees of G-1, G-2, G-3 or Yes\nG-4 visa holders and their immediate family members\nH-1B Specialty Occupations, DOD workers, fashion models Yes\nH-1C Nurses going to work for up to three years in health professional No\nshortage areas\nH-2A Temporary agricultural workers No\nH-2B Temporary workers, skilled and unskilled No\nH-3 Trainee No\nH-4 Spouse or child of H-1, H-2 or H-3 visa holders H-4\ndependents\nof H-1B Yes;\nall other H-4\ndependents,\nno\nI Visas for foreign media representatives Yes\nJ-1 Visas for exchange visitors No\nJ-2 Spouse or child of J-1 visa holders No\nK-1 Fiancé(e) Yes\nK-2 Minor child of K-1 Yes\nK-3 Spouse of a U.S. citizen (LIFE Act) Yes\nK-4 Child of a K-3 (LIFE Act) Yes\nL1-A Executive, managerial Yes\nL1-B Specialized knowledge Yes\nL-2 Spouse or child of L-1 Yes\nM-1 Vocational or other nonacademic students, other than language No\nstudents\nM-2 Immediate families of M-1 visa holders No\nM-3 Vocational students who are Canadian or Mexican citizens, who No**\ncommute across the border to study full-time or part-time in the U.S.\nN-8 Parent of alien classified as SK-3 “Special Immigrant” Yes\nN-9 Child of N-8, SK-1, SK-2, or SK-4 “Special Immigrant” Yes\nNAFT North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (see TN, below) No\nA\nEligible to\nVisa Domicile in the\nType Nonimmigrant (Temporary) Visa Categories United States?

If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

However, an L-1 visa may also be considered for jobs that require intimate knowledge of internal company procedures. This is, nevertheless, vital in such cases in which the skills required for the position are not available on the U.S. labor market. 3. Duration of the activity and full-time employment\n\nLast but not least, it is required that the employee to be sent to the USA has been employed by the German company in a managerial position or with specialized knowledge for at least one year within three years prior to the application process. It should also be noted that only full-time employment can be considered and that part-time employment, even over several years, is not sufficient under any conditions. All requirements must be fulfilled when submitting the petition\nIt should be borne in mind that all the factual requirements that must be met for the petition to be approved must be in place at the time the petition is submitted. If documents, evidence or information are missing, the USCIS will usually request them (request for evidence), but no opportunities will be granted to first create the additional necessary conditions. For example, if the U.S. company is based in one U.S. state but the petitioner intends to do business in a different U.S. state, both the state permits must have been granted and an office must already have been leased when the petition is filed. If the applicant forgot to submit the tenancy agreement, this can usually be submitted at a later date. If, however, the applicant forgot to conclude such a contract, it is not helpful to quickly achieve this and send it after the petition has been received. An entirely new petition must be submitted. Blanket Petition - When the petition for an L-1 visa is not applicable\nThe application process for an L-1 visa is rather complex. The U.S. employer must file a petition with a wide variety of documentation with the U.S. immigration authorities (USCIS) in advance. Only after the petition has been approved can the employee then apply for the actual visa at the U.S. consulate. However, companies that meet some special requirements have the opportunity to apply for a so-called blanket petition. This makes it possible for the employees to be posted to actually only be required to attend the appointment at the U.S. consulate. Thus, it is no longer necessary to submit a petition in advance. Generally, only a U.S. company that has been in business for at least one year and meets one of the following requirements is eligible for a so-called blanket petition:\n\nAt least ten L-1 visas have been successfully applied for via the U.S. company (or U.S. group) in the past twelve months (namely, for managers, executives or so-called specialized knowledge professionals, whereby only members of certain occupational groups fall into the latter category, i.e."}, {"uid": "271", "score": 0.48277992010116577, "meta": {"source": "US_3.pdf", "chunk_id": 271}, "text": "Eligible Non-immigrants -- Persons with Visas that Allow them to Domicile in the\nUnited States\nEligible to\nVisa Domicile in the\nType Nonimmigrant (Temporary) Visa Categories United States?

CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe UK Student visa process is rule‑based and document‑heavy. Many refusals arise from\nmissing, inconsistent or incorrectly formatted documents rather than from ineligibility. A\nrobust visa‑screening system should therefore:\n- Mirror the official GOV.UK structure: “Check if this visa is right for you”, “Prepare the\nevidence you need”, “Apply”, and so on. - Provide dynamic checklists based on the applicant’s circumstances (age, nationality,\nwhere they apply from, dependants, previous sponsorship). - Guide applicants step by step to upload each required document in the correct format. - Highlight high‑risk areas, such as financial evidence and TB certificates, where refusals are\ncommon. - Store structured metadata (for example, document type, issue date, issuing authority,\ncurrency, balance) so that automated validation rules can be applied. For real visa applications, applicants must always rely on the most recent Home Office\nguidance and, where necessary, professional immigration advice. However, this document\ngives a comprehensive, structured view of the evidence typically needed for UK Student visa\nscreening and can be used both as a learning aid and as source material inside a\nRetrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system for query answering."}, {"uid": "311", "score": 0.38807255029678345, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 311}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications. In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

Evidence may include:\n- An academic qualification taught in English and accepted by UKVI as meeting the\nrequirement; or\n- An approved English language test (for example IELTS for UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI or\nsimilar) at the level appropriate for your course; or\n- Being a national of a majority English‑speaking country listed by the Home Office; or\n- Having completed a degree‑level qualification in the UK previously. Screening checks:\n- Does the course require English evidence based on its level and whether it is below degree\nlevel? - If a test certificate is used:\n– Is the test provider on the list of approved Secure English Language Test (SELT)\nproviders? – Is the test still valid on the date of application? – Are the scores at or above the minimum for the CAS/course level? 4.2 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\nFor certain postgraduate courses in sensitive subjects (mainly science, engineering and\ntechnology fields), students of specific nationalities must obtain an ATAS certificate before\napplying for a visa. Key points:\n- The CAS will normally state whether ATAS is required and include the relevant subject\ncode. - The ATAS certificate is issued as a digital letter. It must be valid (usually 6 months) when\nthe visa application is submitted. - If ATAS is required and not provided, the visa will be refused."}, {"uid": "116", "score": 0.492081880569458, "meta": {"source": "ireland_visa5.pdf", "chunk_id": 116}, "text": "Sponsor\n3.4 Studying for If you plan to study for 90 days or less, include information about your study ☐ ☐ Evidence of Link\nless than 90 plan as per the Irish immigration website: to Reference /\ndays https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-study-in-ireland/what-are-my-study- Sponsor\nvisa-options/how-to-apply-for-a-short-c-visit-study-visa/\n3.5 Marrying / If marrying or availing of private medical procedures please read the specific ☐ ☐ Evidence of Link\nmedical requirements, as per the URL in 3.4. to Reference /\ntreatment Sponsor\nEmbassy of Ireland\nC-17, Malcha Marg, Chanakyapuri\nNew Delhi - 110 021, India https://www.ireland.ie/en/india/newdelhi/\n# Category Sub- Comments For use by VFS only\ncategory\nSubmitted?

PREVIOUS SPONSORSHIP CONSENT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf, in the last 12 months, you were financially sponsored by a government or an\ninternational scholarship agency for both tuition fees and living costs, and that sponsorship\nhas ended, you must provide a letter from that sponsor giving you unconditional consent to\nremain or re‑enter the UK for further study. The consent letter should:\n- Be on official letterhead;\n- Include your full name and, ideally, your date of birth or passport number;\n- Confirm that the sponsor supports your new course in the UK and has no objection to your\nvisa application; and\n- Be signed, dated and include contact information of an authorised official.

Common types of academic evidence:\n- Certificates of qualification (for example, 12th grade mark sheet, bachelor’s degree\ncertificate);\n- Official transcripts of results, stamped or sealed by the institution;\n- Printouts of results from an awarding body’s secure online verification system. Screening checks:\n- Do the qualification names and grades match the details in the CAS? - Are documents genuine‑looking (correct logos, spelling, signatures, seals)? - If any document is not in English or Welsh, is a certified translation attached? ------------------------------------------------------------\n9. TRANSLATIONS AND DOCUMENT FORMAT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny supporting document that is not in English or Welsh must be accompanied by a fully\ncertified translation. The translation must:\n- Be done by a professional translator or translation company;\n- Include confirmation that it is an accurate translation of the original document;\n- Include the date of translation;\n- Include the translator’s or translation company’s full name and contact details; and\n- Bear the translator’s signature.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND ATAS EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4.1 Proving knowledge of English\nFor most Student visa applications, you must show that you can speak, read, write and\nunderstand English to a certain level. Evidence may include:\n- An academic qualification taught in English and accepted by UKVI as meeting the\nrequirement; or\n- An approved English language test (for example IELTS for UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI or\nsimilar) at the level appropriate for your course; or\n- Being a national of a majority English‑speaking country listed by the Home Office; or\n- Having completed a degree‑level qualification in the UK previously. Screening checks:\n- Does the course require English evidence based on its level and whether it is below degree\nlevel? - If a test certificate is used:\n– Is the test provider on the list of approved Secure English Language Test (SELT)\nproviders? – Is the test still valid on the date of application? – Are the scores at or above the minimum for the CAS/course level? 4.2 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\nFor certain postgraduate courses in sensitive subjects (mainly science, engineering and\ntechnology fields), students of specific nationalities must obtain an ATAS certificate before\napplying for a visa. Key points:\n- The CAS will normally state whether ATAS is required and include the relevant subject\ncode. - The ATAS certificate is issued as a digital letter. It must be valid (usually 6 months) when\nthe visa application is submitted. - If ATAS is required and not provided, the visa will be refused."}, {"uid": "103", "score": 0.47419270873069763, "meta": {"source": "ireland001.txt", "chunk_id": 103}, "text": "An employment permit holder:\nA copy of their contract of employment of at least 1 year from your proposed date of entry giving their annual salary is also required. 8.

Medical or travel insurance\nEvidence of medical or travel insurance does not need to be provided with your application. However, the Visa Officer may request it before they make a decision on your application. If your visa is approved, you must have evidence of medical or travel insurance when you arrive at the port of entry (airport or seaport) and must present it to the Immigration Officer on request. 10. Previous Visa Refusals\nIf you have been refused a visa in the past for any country, you must provide the details.

CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES FOR U.S. VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe U.S. student visa system is structured around three big questions:\n1. Are you a genuine student? 2. Can you afford to study without breaking the rules? 3. Will you respect the terms of the visa and U.S. law? Most document requirements and interview questions connect back to these three ideas. Many refusals happen not because a student is ineligible, but because the application file is\nincomplete, inconsistent, or poorly explained. A well‑designed U.S. visa‑screening tool or RAG‑based assistant should therefore:\n- Collect all core documents in a structured way (passport, DS‑160 details, I‑20, SEVIS\nreceipt, financial evidence, academic records). - Automatically cross‑check names, dates, and key numbers to catch mistakes early. - Calculate approximate minimum funding requirements and compare them against\nuploaded financial documents. - Ask dynamic follow‑up questions based on risk indicators (large recent deposits, frequent\nprevious refusals, weak explanation of course choice). - Provide customised checklists based on the country of application, visa category\n(F‑1/M‑1/J‑1), and presence of dependants. - Offer practice interview prompts and feedback that help applicants give clear, truthful,\nand concise answers. - Emphasise honesty and consistency across all stages: university application, DS‑160,\ninterview, and arrival at the port of entry. For real applications, students must always follow the latest instructions from\ntravel.state.gov, the SEVP/SEVIS program, and their local U.S. embassy or consulate.

J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE DOCUMENTS FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Form DS‑160 – Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application\nEvery nonimmigrant visa applicant must complete Form DS‑160 online and submit it\nelectronically. The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history,\nfamily information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media\nidentifiers. Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years. Officers may review online content as part of security vetting."}, {"uid": "277", "score": 0.5216214060783386, "meta": {"source": "US_5.pdf", "chunk_id": 277}, "text": "11/27/25, 10:42 AM Student Visa\n\nStudent Visa\n\nOverview\n\nGenerally, foreign nationals who wish to travel to the United\nStates must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa\nfor a temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent\nresidence. You must have a student visa to travel to the\nUnited States to study. Your course of study and the type of\nschool you plan to attend determine whether you need an F\nvisa or an M visa. You need the\nTo enter the United States to attend: following visa\ncategory:\n\nUniversity or college\n\nPrivate elementary school\n\nSeminary\nConservatory\n\nAnother academic institution,\nincluding a language training program\n\nVocational or other recognized\nnonacademic institution, other than a\nlanguage training program\n\nStudents cannot travel on the Visa Waiver Program or with\nVisitor Visas\n\nYou must have a student visa (F or M visa) to travel to the\nUnited States to study. You may not study after entering on\na visitor (B) visa, unless you are eligible for and have\nobtained a change of status from USCIS, or through the\nVisa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake\nrecreational (non-credit) study as part of a tourist visit. For\nmore information on the VWP, see Visa Waiver Program. For short periods of recreational study, a Visitor (B) visa\n\nmay be appropriate\n\nA visitor (B) visa permits enrollment in a short recreational ee\ncourse of study, which is not for credit toward a degree or\n\nacademic certificate.

For example, a student in a distance learning\nprogram that requires a period of time on the institution's\nU.S. campus must obtain a student (F or M) visa prior to\nentering the United States. Student Acceptance at a SEVP Approved School\n\nThe first step to studying in the United States is apply to a\nSEVP-approved school in the United States. If the SEVP-\napproved school accepts your enrollment, you will be\nregistered for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information\nSystem (SEVIS)@ and must pay the SEVIS I-901 fee. The\nSEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20. After you\nreceive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply\nat a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa. You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when\nyou attend your visa interview. If your spouse and/or children will live with you in the\nUnited States while you study, they must also enroll in\nSEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved\nschool, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS\nfee).

A comprehensive system may still track it so that checklists shown to students are\ncomplete. ------------------------------------------------------------\n4. FINANCIAL EVIDENCE FOR STUDY IN THE U.S.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA major part of U.S. student visa screening is verifying that the applicant can afford their\neducation without working illegally or relying on public funds. 4.1 How much funding is required? The minimum funding is usually based on the school’s estimate of:\n- Tuition and required fees for one academic year (or the whole program if shorter), and\n- Estimated living expenses (housing, food, insurance, books, etc.) for 9–12 months. These estimates appear on the I‑20 or DS‑2019. Some consulates also publish rough funding\nguidelines. Students must show they have enough money from acceptable sources to cover\nthese costs for at least the first year, and often must indicate a plausible plan for the entire\nprogram duration. 4.2 Types of acceptable financial documents\nCommon evidence includes:\n- Bank statements or bank letters for personal savings accounts. - Fixed deposits or certificates of deposit that can be liquidated. - Scholarship letters from the school or external sponsors. - Approved educational loan letters. - Evidence of sponsor income such as salary slips, tax returns, or business registration if the\nfunds come from parents or relatives. The screening system should verify that:\n- The documents clearly show the account holder’s name, institution name, account\nnumber, and currency. - Balances are sufficient to meet or exceed the required amount when converted to U.S.\ndollars using an appropriate rate. - Funds appear stable and legitimately obtained rather than sudden unexplained large\ndeposits immediately before the visa interview. - If multiple sponsors are used, the combined funding still meets the requirement and each\nsponsor’s relationship to the student is documented. 4.3 Sponsor relationship and intent\nIn many countries, parents or close relatives act as financial sponsors. Officers will look for:\n- Proof of relationship (birth certificates, family registers, etc., if requested). - A reasonable link between the sponsor’s income and the promised funding. - A logical explanation of why the sponsor is willing and able to support the student. For visa‑screening logic, flags should appear when income seems inconsistent with savings,\nor when the sponsor is a distant acquaintance with no clear reason to provide large sums. 4.4 Common financial refusal patterns\nTypical reasons for denial related to finance include:\n- Insufficient funds to cover tuition plus living costs."}, {"uid": "284", "score": 0.5118120908737183, "meta": {"source": "US_6.pdf", "chunk_id": 284}, "text": "Wait times for interview appointments vary by location,\nseason, and visa category, so you should apply for your visa\nearly.

Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.4688485562801361, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees.

Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees.

The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.4272472620010376, "vector_score": 0.6103532314300537, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."}, {"uid": "332", "score": 0.41126300096511836, "vector_score": 0.587518572807312, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 332}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications.

Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.4272472620010376, "vector_score": 0.6103532314300537, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."}, {"uid": "332", "score": 0.41126300096511836, "vector_score": 0.587518572807312, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 332}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications. In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature.

Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.4272472620010376, "vector_score": 0.6103532314300537, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."}, {"uid": "332", "score": 0.41126300096511836, "vector_score": 0.587518572807312, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 332}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications.

Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.3995717287063598, "vector_score": 0.5708167552947998, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions. Contents on this page:\n\nWhat qualifications do applicants need to have? What are the requirements for the workplace? What is the application process? What is the H-1B quota system? What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."}, {"uid": "332", "score": 0.37261804938316345, "vector_score": 0.5323114991188049, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 332}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications. In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation.

E-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA\nE-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA - Visa Application Services\nIf you want to live in the USA for a longer period of time, a U.S. E visa is a good option. The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter. The maximum stay may not exceed six years."}, {"uid": "302", "score": 0.3421994417905807, "vector_score": 0.48885634541511536, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_5.pdf", "chunk_id": 302}, "text": "Although SEVIS\nfee payment is not required, your school must\nissue them an individual Form I-20, which is\nrequired to apply for their visas.

OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems\ncarry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1\nvisa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE DOCUMENTS FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Form DS‑160 – Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application\nEvery nonimmigrant visa applicant must complete Form DS‑160 online and submit it\nelectronically. The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history,\nfamily information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media\nidentifiers. Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years.

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.3995717287063598, "vector_score": 0.5708167552947998, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees.

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature.

Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States.

The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter.

OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems\ncarry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1\nvisa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2.

Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years.

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."}, {"uid": "329", "score": 0.3995717287063598, "vector_score": 0.5708167552947998, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 329}, "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions.

Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."}, {"uid": "332", "score": 0.37261804938316345, "vector_score": 0.5323114991188049, "keyword_score": 0.0, "meta": {"source": "US_Visa.txt", "chunk_id": 332}, "text": "List of H-2B eligible nationals\nWorldwide advice on U.S. employment visas\nNationals of the following countries are currently eligible for the H-2B category:\n\nAndorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malta, Moldova, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nauru, The Netherlands, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, The Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vanuatu (status as of spring 2018)\n\nH-2B applicant’s qualifications – university degree not required\nIn contrast to the H-1B visa category, the H-2B applicant is not required to provide proof of specific qualifications. In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States.

The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter.

OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems\ncarry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1\nvisa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2.

The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history,\nfamily information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media\nidentifiers. Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years.

United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.
