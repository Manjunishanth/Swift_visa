Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

Schengen Area — Short-stay (visa) eligibility reference (tourist / business / short study / transit) — common rules across Schengen states\n\nOVERVIEW\nSchengen short-stay visa (Type C) rules are harmonized: common documentation includes valid passport, travel itinerary, sufficient funds, travel medical insurance, purpose evidence, and proof of intended return. Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes). SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes).

It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND ATAS EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4.1 Proving knowledge of English\nFor most Student visa applications, you must show that you can speak, read, write and\nunderstand English to a certain level. Evidence may include:\n- An academic qualification taught in English and accepted by UKVI as meeting the\nrequirement; or\n- An approved English language test (for example IELTS for UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI or\nsimilar) at the level appropriate for your course; or\n- Being a national of a majority English‑speaking country listed by the Home Office; or\n- Having completed a degree‑level qualification in the UK previously. Screening checks:\n- Does the course require English evidence based on its level and whether it is below degree\nlevel? - If a test certificate is used:\n– Is the test provider on the list of approved Secure English Language Test (SELT)\nproviders? – Is the test still valid on the date of application? – Are the scores at or above the minimum for the CAS/course level? 4.2 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\nFor certain postgraduate courses in sensitive subjects (mainly science, engineering and\ntechnology fields), students of specific nationalities must obtain an ATAS certificate before\napplying for a visa. Key points:\n- The CAS will normally state whether ATAS is required and include the relevant subject\ncode. - The ATAS certificate is issued as a digital letter. It must be valid (usually 6 months) when\nthe visa application is submitted. - If ATAS is required and not provided, the visa will be refused."

Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment.

Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages.

Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes). SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

The Schengen\ncountries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\nMalta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and three non-\nEU member states: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In order for applicants to know in which European Embassy they need to apply for a\nSchengen visa, they need to determine the main destination of their journey. The main\ndestination is determined by the purpose of the applicants visit:\nFor example:\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries for\nequal amount of days, the main destination is the country of point of entry;\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries but\nstay in one country longer than the other, the main destination is the country in which\nthe applicant stays the longest period of time;\n If the applicant intends to visit a Schengen country for a particular purpose (e.g. sports, culture) then the main destination is the country in which the purpose is to be\nfulfilled independent of whether other countries are visited first or for a longer period\nof time. Applicants may apply for a Schengen visa at the following European Embassies in Port of\nSpain:\n If the main destination is Estonia, Germany, Italy or Portugal: please apply at the\nEmbassy of the Federal Republic of Germany;\n If the main destination is Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands,\nLuxemburg, Norway, Poland or Sweden: please apply at the Embassy of the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands;\n If the main destination is France or Spain: please apply at the Embassy of the\nKingdom of Spain;\nTravellers to Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia and Switzerland need to consult with the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs of\nthese countries in order to obtain further information. The EU member states that are not in the Schengen area, or are yet to implement the\nSchengen Regulation are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. Short stay visitors\nto Ireland should check with the relevant authorities of that country to determine whether or\nnot they need a visa. Travellers who wish to travel to Cyprus and are holders of a valid Schengen Visa (type C,\nsingle, double or multiple entries) and who have already entered Schengen territory according\nto the stipulations governing the issuance of the Schengen Visa they hold, can travel to\nCyprus without acquiring a Cypriot Visa."

          "text": "Yes! AXA will refund your insurance fees if your visa application is rejected in most cases. We’ll only ask that you provide official documentation explaining why your visa was refused (from the relevant embassy, consulate, or visa application center). Will it cost more to obtain a longer-stay Schengen Visa? Generally speaking, there is little difference — as the fee covers the costs of processing your application. However, longer-stay visa applications to work or study are dealt with at a national level — so the requirements may vary, and your destination country may ask you to pay fees covering additional documentation. Can I work or study in the Schengen Zone on a tourist visa? No. While the tourist (or Type C) allows visitors to enter the Schengen for a short business trip, a holiday, and/or to visit family members, it cannot be converted into a work or study permit. AXA can tell you more. What should I do if my visa is refused? You can either apply again or appeal. The EU’s Article 32(3) of the Visa Code of the Schengen Agreement can tell you more — but the outcome of your appeal will ultimately depend on the individual Schengen country’s authorities. How to apply for a Schengen business visa to Europe? Travel Insurance is mandatory to obtain a Schengen visa\n\nWritten by: Kurt Hambadda\nPublished on: 07/18/2025\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (aka IATA), roughly 600 million business trips are taken globally each year. And a good chunk of these, of course, happens to be to, from, and throughout the most visited continent on the planet – aka Europe. If you too are planning to be among the thousands of people saying “business” at a European airport on any given day, you might be wondering about the right type of visa for your trip. And that’s why AXA has all you need to know about the Schengen business visa below. What is a Schengen Business Visa? Who needs a Schengen Business visa? What are the main requirements for a Business Schengen Visa application? Where and when should I apply for a Business Schengen Visa? Tips to complete the application process for a Business Schengen Visa\nWhy choose AXA Travel Insurance for my Business Schengen Visa? Schengen Business Visa FAQ\nWhat Is a Schengen Business Visa? As its name suggests, a Schengen Business Visa is essentially a type of short-stay (aka Type C) Schengen visa ​–​this one designed specifically for non EU/EEA nationals traveling to the Schengen Area for business-related activities. Think meetings, conferences, contract negotiations, industry events, and so on (IMPORTANT: However, don’t think full-time employment–but more on that in our FAQs section below). Being granted a Schengen Business Visa (or a Business Schengen visa, if you prefer as they’re interchangeable) allows you to enter not just one but any of Europe’s dozens of Schengen countries. And, once there, it also offers you the freedom to cross any of their borders, and without needing any other separate visas."

          "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions. Contents on this page:\n\nWhat qualifications do applicants need to have? What are the requirements for the workplace? What is the application process? What is the H-1B quota system? What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years."

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4.

United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

The Schengen\ncountries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\nMalta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and three non-\nEU member states: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In order for applicants to know in which European Embassy they need to apply for a\nSchengen visa, they need to determine the main destination of their journey. The main\ndestination is determined by the purpose of the applicants visit:\nFor example:\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries for\nequal amount of days, the main destination is the country of point of entry;\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries but\nstay in one country longer than the other, the main destination is the country in which\nthe applicant stays the longest period of time;\n If the applicant intends to visit a Schengen country for a particular purpose (e.g. sports, culture) then the main destination is the country in which the purpose is to be\nfulfilled independent of whether other countries are visited first or for a longer period\nof time. Applicants may apply for a Schengen visa at the following European Embassies in Port of\nSpain:\n If the main destination is Estonia, Germany, Italy or Portugal: please apply at the\nEmbassy of the Federal Republic of Germany;\n If the main destination is Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands,\nLuxemburg, Norway, Poland or Sweden: please apply at the Embassy of the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands;\n If the main destination is France or Spain: please apply at the Embassy of the\nKingdom of Spain;\nTravellers to Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia and Switzerland need to consult with the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs of\nthese countries in order to obtain further information. The EU member states that are not in the Schengen area, or are yet to implement the\nSchengen Regulation are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. Short stay visitors\nto Ireland should check with the relevant authorities of that country to determine whether or\nnot they need a visa. Travellers who wish to travel to Cyprus and are holders of a valid Schengen Visa (type C,\nsingle, double or multiple entries) and who have already entered Schengen territory according\nto the stipulations governing the issuance of the Schengen Visa they hold, can travel to\nCyprus without acquiring a Cypriot Visa."

          "text": "And, finally, depending on your particular travel needs, the Type C Schengen visa can also be issued as single, double, or multiple-entry\n\nLong-stay visa for the Schengen (Type D)\nMeanwhile, if you’re planning to stay in a particular Schengen country for more than 90 days, you’ll have to opt for what’s known as the Type D (aka “long stay”, aka “national”) visa. And this part is a bit tricky. Namely because — while issued by a Schengen country — a long-stay national visa (Type D) is not technically considered “a Schengen visa” in the traditional sense. Instead, the Type D visa is issued by a single Schengen member state to individuals intending to stay longer than 90 days in that particular country — for purposes such as work, training programs, internships, school, family reunification, and so on. However, while the visa primarily grants access to one particular Schengen country, it does also allow its holder to travel freely within the Schengen Area for up to 90 days in any 180-day period during their visa's validity — thus making it similar to the Type C visa. So while a Type D visa is not a \"Schengen visa\" per se, it does allow movement within the Schengen Area under certain conditions. Business, work, and student Schengen Visas\nDepending on the nature of your particular trip, your Schengen (and/or national) visa can also come in the form of business, work, or study. These subcategories are fairly self-explanatory and do not generally apply to the Schengen Type A (aka ATV “airport transit”) visa. However, they can be used for both short and long stays in the Schengen (i.e., either the Type C or Type D visas) — depending on your particular trip. So if you’re not just vacationing in Europe but rather going on business or to work or study, AXA can also gladly tell you all you need to know below:\n\nWhat is a Schengen business visa (and how do I get one)? What is a Schengen work visa (and how do I get one)? How to get a work visa for France\nHow to get a work visa for Germany\nWhat is a Schengen student visa (and how do I get one)? Single-Entry, Double-Entry, and Multiple-Entry Schengen Visas\nAnd, finally, you also have three options in terms of how often you want to enter the Schengen Zone for your European trip. And here’s a breakdown of those three Schengen visa types*:\n\nSingle-Entry Visa:\n\nAllows you to enter the Schengen Area only once. After you leave, the visa becomes invalid (and that’s even if its validity period hasn't expired). Marked with a \"1\" on the visa sticker\n\nPRO-TIP: AXA can tell you all about how to read your Schengen Visa Sticker and Number too. Double-Entry Visa:\nGrants two entries into the Schengen Area — meaning you can leave and re-enter once within the visa's validity period (perfect for a side trip to a Schengen-neighboring country, for example)."

          "text": "What is a Schengen visa? A Schengen visa is an entry permit for non-EU nationals to make a short, temporary visit of up to 90 days in any 180-day period to a country in the Schengen area. Schengen visas come in 3 forms: \n\nsingle-entry visa - allowing you to enter the Schengen area once;\nmultiple-entry visa - allowing several visits to the Schengen area for as long as the visa is valid;\nairport transit visa - allows you to connect through the international transit area of an airport in the Schengen area during a stopover or a change of flights. It does not allow you to leave the international transit area. How long can you stay? The short-stay calculator can help you calculate the remaining period you are allowed to stay in a Schengen country. Who needs to apply for a Schengen visa? Citizens of certain non-EU countries must hold a short-stay visa when travelling to the Schengen area. Consult the EU list of countries whose citizens are required to hold a visa when crossing its external borders. There are exceptions to the visa requirements for certain types of traveller to certain countries (e.g. diplomats, armed forces, refugees, pupils on school excursions). Airport transit visas\n\nSome non-EU nationals must also hold an airport transit visa when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in any of the Schengen States. For citizens of certain additional countries, an airport transit visa is required when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in some of the Schengen countries. There are some categories of people who are exempt from the requirement to hold an airport transit visa (see Article 3(5) of the Visa Code). Where to apply\nYou must lodge your application for a Schengen visa at the consulate of the country you intend to visit. Visiting more than 1 Schengen countries: apply at the consulate of the country where you will spend the longest time. Visiting several Schengen countries (for stays of equal length): apply at the consulate of the first country you will visit. As a general rule, you must apply for a Schengen visa at the consulate with territorial responsibility for the country where you are legally resident. When to apply\nYou must submit your application to the consulate at least 15 days before your intended journey and no earlier than 6 months beforehand. You may have to book an appointment before lodging the application. What documents are needed to apply? A valid passport. The passport’s expiry date should be at least 3 months after the date of your departure from the Schengen area. For multiple-entry visas, the expiry date should be at least 3 months after your departure from the last country visited. A visa application form. A photo in compliance with ICAO standards. Medical insurance covering emergency medical care, hospitalisation and repatriation (including in the event of death)."

And to learn more, you should consult the European Union Visa Code (Article 3 – Paragraph 5). -Meanwhile, some Schengen countries require citizens from certain countries not listed above to obtain a Transit Visa (VTA) when passing through the international transit area of airports located in their territory. And to find out if these conditions apply to you, we recommend checking directly with the authorities of the Schengen countries you will be transiting through. - Moreover, if you have to leave the airport of a Schengen country for a connection at another airport (or train/bus station, etc.) and/or have a layover outside the international zone of the airport — you must apply for a Type C visa if your nationality requires one (even if it's for a short period of time)\nSchengen visa: Type C\nNow, the Type C (aka “short-stay” aka “tourist”) Schengen Visa is the most common type of visa for Europe the world over. And understandably so. Because the Type C Schengen visa ultimately allows travelers in its possession to visit and stay in one or all of the Schengen countries for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. As such, it’s used for anything from brief European getaways to multi-country backpacking adventures and road trips to short business trips and visiting friends and relatives in the Schengen Zone. Meanwhile, the Type C Schengen Visa is also sometimes divided into two key subcategories*, which are:\n\n-Visa with Limited Territorial Validity (aka LTV), which restricts travel to specific Schengen countries — meaning the holder cannot move freely across the entire Schengen zone— and is usually granted for humanitarian reasons or in urgent cases. -Visa Issued at the External Border, which is issued directly at border crossings for unforeseen, urgent reasons, typically valid for a very short stay, and applies only to the country issuing it. *Neither of the above visas is very common at all. The former (LTV) is issued mainly in exceptional cases (like urgent humanitarian situations) or for those whose travel documents are not accepted by all Schengen countries. Whereas the latter (“external border”) — which is even rarer — is typically issued during emergencies (like unexpected medical needs) and is generally restricted to one or two countries within the Schengen zone."

Is there anything else I need to apply for a Schengen student visa? If you are a student at an institution in your home country, planning to travel to the Schengen Area to study for a period, you may want to get a no objection letter from officials at your university. This is a short letter stating that they have ‘no objection’ to you traveling as they expect you to return to your studies after your trip. It can help with your visa application as it helps confirm that you will not overstay your Schengen student visa. You should ask someone in a position of responsibility for this. How much time does it get to obtain a Schengen student visa? The processing of your application will take six to eight weeks. We advise you to apply well in advance of the proposed beginning of your studies. Can I work while I study? Working while in a country on a student visa is against the law without securing an employment visa from your host government. Therefore, you can combine studying with work. For example, in France, the law authorizes foreign students to work 964 hours, which corresponds to 60 percent of normal working hours. However, part-time work will not be sufficient to cover all your expenses and should be considered as a secondary source of income. Violating these rules could seriously jeopardize your studies and future employment prospects, as breaking local immigration laws may result in a travel ban. Where do I obtain the form to apply for a Student Visa? A Student Schengen Visa form should be available from the website of the consulate of the country or visa application center you are applying to visit. For example, Indian students who apply for a Student visa in Germany will find the information here: india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2288440#content_0\n\nCan I extend a Schengen student visa? A Schengen student visa can be extended only in some very specific cases, such as late entry, humanitarian reasons, important personal reasons, or some kind of unforeseeable circumstances. You cannot extend your Schengen student visa for the purpose of continuing your studies. If you do wish to continue your studies beyond the original period planned, you will have to return to your home country or country of residence and apply for a long-stay study visa. How can AXA help? With time of the essence, it’s better to apply for a European study visa as soon as possible. AXA can help by providing you a low cost student travel insurance that meets your Europe student visa requirements. Perfect for those on a tight student budget!

Countries also have their own student visa criteria that must be met if you want to study there:\n\nFor example, students in Italy must prove they have the financial support of at least €448 per month for the duration of studies. Those studying in Italy must also obtain a residency permit. Getting a visa to study in Germany requires proof you have the funds: an average student needs to live on - €853 per month.

Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

          "text": "# ✅ **DOCUMENT 2 — UNITED KINGDOM (UK) — VISA ELIGIBILITY (CLEAN TEXT)**\n\n**Covers:** Skilled Worker Visa, Student Visa (Tier 4). ---\n\n## **Skilled Worker Visa (Work Visa) Eligibility**\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6. Applicant must maintain financial funds (unless employer certifies maintenance). **Eligibility Notes:**\n\n* Applicant’s **income at home does not affect eligibility**. * Age does not matter. * Salary offered by UK employer must meet **threshold**, not applicant’s current salary. ---\n\n## **UK Student Visa Eligibility**\n\n1. **CAS letter** from a licensed education provider. 2. Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."

          "text": "Introduction\nAll individuals who apply at a Consulate or Embassy abroad for a United States entry or re-entry visa are\nscreened before the visa is issued, regardless of nationality. The U.S. has strict visa laws because it is an\nopen society. Unlike many other countries, the nation does not impose internal controls such as registration\nwith local authorities on its visitors. Yet, in order to enjoy the privilege of unencumbered travel in the U.S.,\ncertain requirements must be met. In particular, a foreign traveler has a responsibility to prove that he or she is going to return home from\ntravel abroad before a visitor visa will be issued. U.S. consular officers are required by law to view every\nvisa applicant as an intending immigrant until the applicant proves otherwise. Section 214(b) of the U.S.\nImmigration and Naturalization Act states: “Every alien shall presumed to be an immigrant until he\nestablishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is\nentitled to a nonimmigrant status.” Though the actual approval rate for first time visa applicants processed\nduring 2004 through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing remains near 70%, most of those visa applications that\nwere denied were refused under the terms of Section 214(b). More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 4\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n2 U.S. Visa Types for Business Travel\nThe United States issues two types of visas: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant. Within the nonimmigrant classification, multiple types of visa classes exist. “B” type visa referrals are\nappropriate for standardization experts from the People’s Republic of China who are invited to the U.S. to\nparticipate in either a meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO), or for those who are invited by U.S. firms as temporary visitors for\nbusiness. Visa Class – Type “B” Purpose of Travel\nB1 Temporary visitor for business\nB2 Temporary visitor for pleasure\nB1/B2 Temporary visitor for business or pleasure\n[NOTE: For a complete list of visa classes, please see Annex A of this document.] The B1 visa is intended for temporary business travel. This includes such travel as for the purpose of\nnegotiating contracts, attending exhibitions and conferences, short-term training, and consultations with\nsuppliers and customers. The B1 visa is not valid for employment in the U.S. The B2 visa is intended for tourist activities, such as sightseeing, visiting friends and relatives, obtaining\nmedical treatment, and attending non-vocational conferences and meetings. Visitors are not permitted to\naccept employment during their stay in the U.S. B2 visas are valid for one entry within three months of the\nissuance date. In some instances, a consular officer may elect to issue a B1 visa jointly with a B2 visa type. Generally, a\nB1/B2 visa means that while in the U.S. as a business visitor, an individual may attend meetings, and\nparticipate in them fully, conduct research, and engage in other business negotations."

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6.

Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

          "text": "────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSECTION 1 — CRITICAL SKILLS EMPLOYMENT PERMIT (CSEP)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPURPOSE\nThe Critical Skills Employment Permit (CSEP) is for occupations considered high-skilled and intended to attract highly skilled workers to Ireland. It encourages skilled migration with facilitated access for family members and faster routes to long-term residency. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\n\nMANDATORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (ALL must be satisfied)\n1. **Job & Employer**\n - You must have a genuine job offer from an Irish employer. - The job must fall into occupations the DETE recognises for Critical Skills or otherwise meet the remuneration criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}\n\n2. **Minimum Remuneration (salary)**\n - For many Critical Skills roles, the published minimum remuneration threshold is **€38,000 per year**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} \n - For some roles / circumstances the alternative higher threshold **€64,000** applies (for roles not on the critical skills list or when degree is not applicable) — the DETE page states which roles and when the higher threshold applies. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n\n **What counts as remuneration:** basic salary, certain allowances and regular payments as listed by DETE — consult the DETE remuneration rules on the Critical Skills page. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\n3. **Qualifications**\n - Typically requires a relevant third-level degree (or equivalent professional qualifications) for roles on the Critical Skills list. - The DETE guidance clarifies required qualifications by occupation; check the specific occupation guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\n4. **Labour Market Needs Test**\n - The CSEP is normally **exempt** from the labour market needs test (LMNT) that applies to some General Employment Permit applications — that is one reason CSEP is preferred for high-skilled roles. Confirm on the DETE page. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}\n\nBENEFITS (clear)\n- Dependants: Spouses/partners and dependants of CSEP holders may come to Ireland and are generally entitled to apply for permission to work (through the Dependant/Partner/Spouse Employment Permit or equivalent route). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}\n\nEVIDENCE CHECKLIST (minimum)\n- Signed job offer / employment contract with salary and duties. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} \n- Proof of qualifications (degree certificates, transcripts, professional registration). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} \n- Employer details and company documentation if requested. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}\n\nCOMMON REASONS FOR REFUSAL (explicit)\n- Salary below the published threshold and not justified by an applicable exception. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} \n- Job not matching Critical Skills list requirements or insufficient proof of skill level. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nSECTION 2 — GENERAL EMPLOYMENT PERMIT (GEP)\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nPURPOSE\nGeneral Employment Permit enables employers to hire non-EEA nationals for occupations not listed under Critical Skills but where a Labour Market Needs Test (advertising the role) is met. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nMANDATORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (ALL must be satisfied)\n1. **Minimum Remuneration**\n - The GEP normally requires a minimum annual salary threshold — historically published at **€30,000** (or other current threshold indicated by DETE). Confirm the live DETE page for exact current MAR (minimum annual remuneration). :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}\n\n2. **Labour Market Needs Test (LMNT)**\n - Employers must typically advertise the vacancy in Ireland (EURES or other specified channels) for a set period (e.g., 28 days) before submitting the permit application, demonstrating no suitable EEA/Irish candidates were available. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\n3. **Other requirements**\n - Proof of employer capacity to pay the salary and legal compliance."

Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

Key Universal Rules (Apply across Schengen)\n\n### 2.1 The 90/180 Rule (Short-stay limit)\n\n* A non-EU/EEA national may stay in the Schengen Area for **a maximum of 90 days within any rolling 180-day period**. * This is cumulative across all Schengen states (not per country). The 180-day window is rolling (count backwards from each day of intended stay). ### 2.2 Visa Types (Short summary)\n\n* **Type C (Schengen short-stay):** tourism, business, family visit, short studies up to 90/180. * **Type D (National):** long-stay (>90 days) for study, work, family reunification, residence. Issued by individual member states; may allow limited travel within Schengen for short periods. * **Airport Transit Visa (Type A):** transit through international transit zones at airports (rare; many nationals exempt). ### 2.3 Biometric & Application Basics\n\n* Applicants normally **must provide biometric data** (fingerprints + photo) at the visa application center (VFS/consulate), once per 59 months (approx.) unless exempt. * Schengen visas require a **personal application** (rare exceptions for children or specific categories). ### 2.4 Travel Medical Insurance (Mandatory for short-stay)\n\n* For Schengen Type C visas, travel medical insurance is **mandatory** and must cover **medical emergency and repatriation**. * **Minimum cover**: **€30,000** (this is the commonly required minimum across Schengen consulates). Insurance must be valid for the entire period of intended stay and across the whole Schengen area. ### 2.5 Purpose & Supporting Documents (Short-stay)\n\nTypical required documents (vary by consulate / nationality):\n\n* Valid passport (valid for at least 3 months beyond intended departure from Schengen; with at least two blank pages). * Completed and signed visa application form. * Recent passport-style photos. * Proof of purpose: invitation letter, hotel bookings, conference confirmation, enrolment for short course. * Proof of financial means to cover stay. * Proof of travel medical insurance. * Return/onward travel tickets or reservation. * Proof of accommodation. * Visa fee (varies). * For minors: birth certificate, parental consent, custody proof."

          "text": "APPLYING FOR A SCHENGEN VISA\nNEW VISA RULES: Please read the important information in the link, which supplements\nthe information below: new_eu_visa_rules_questions_and_answers.pdf\nThe Schengen Visa holder can travel to any of the 26 countries using one single visa, thus\navoiding the hassle and expense of obtaining individual visas for each country. The Schengen\ncountries are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\nMalta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and three non-\nEU member states: Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. In order for applicants to know in which European Embassy they need to apply for a\nSchengen visa, they need to determine the main destination of their journey. The main\ndestination is determined by the purpose of the applicants visit:\nFor example:\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries for\nequal amount of days, the main destination is the country of point of entry;\n If the applicant intends to travel for holidays to a number of Schengen countries but\nstay in one country longer than the other, the main destination is the country in which\nthe applicant stays the longest period of time;\n If the applicant intends to visit a Schengen country for a particular purpose (e.g. sports, culture) then the main destination is the country in which the purpose is to be\nfulfilled independent of whether other countries are visited first or for a longer period\nof time. Applicants may apply for a Schengen visa at the following European Embassies in Port of\nSpain:\n If the main destination is Estonia, Germany, Italy or Portugal: please apply at the\nEmbassy of the Federal Republic of Germany;\n If the main destination is Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands,\nLuxemburg, Norway, Poland or Sweden: please apply at the Embassy of the Kingdom\nof the Netherlands;\n If the main destination is France or Spain: please apply at the Embassy of the\nKingdom of Spain;\nTravellers to Austria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Slovakia,\nSlovenia and Switzerland need to consult with the respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs of\nthese countries in order to obtain further information. The EU member states that are not in the Schengen area, or are yet to implement the\nSchengen Regulation are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania. Short stay visitors\nto Ireland should check with the relevant authorities of that country to determine whether or\nnot they need a visa. Travellers who wish to travel to Cyprus and are holders of a valid Schengen Visa (type C,\nsingle, double or multiple entries) and who have already entered Schengen territory according\nto the stipulations governing the issuance of the Schengen Visa they hold, can travel to\nCyprus without acquiring a Cypriot Visa."

TUBERCULOSIS (TB) TEST CERTIFICATE\n------------------------------------------------------------\nStudents coming to the UK for more than 6 months from certain listed countries must\nprovide a tuberculosis (TB) test certificate from a Home Office‑approved clinic. Key information from the TB guidance:\n- You need a TB test if:\n– You are coming to the UK for more than 6 months; and\n– You have lived in one of the listed countries for 6 months or more; and\n– You were living in that country (or another listed country) within the last 6 months. - The test is usually a chest x‑ray. If the x‑ray is unclear, you may need a sputum (phlegm)\ntest. - If the test shows you do not have TB, you receive a certificate that is valid for 6 months\nfrom the date of the x‑ray. - Children must attend an approved clinic. Children under 11 usually do not need a chest\nx‑ray, but a medical practitioner must complete a questionnaire and issue a certificate if the\nchild is TB‑free. - There are separate options for pregnant applicants (shielded x‑ray, sputum test, or\npostponing the test until after delivery). Screening checks:\n- Is the applicant applying from a TB‑listed country, or have they recently lived there? - Is the course longer than 6 months (Student visa normally is)? - If yes, has the applicant provided a TB certificate issued by an approved clinic? - Is the certificate:\n– Less than 6 months old on the date of application? – Clearly matching the applicant’s identity details? - For dependants applying with the student, each dependant from a TB‑listed country must\nalso provide a TB certificate. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6.

New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nIn a recent update in September 2025, President Donald Trump amended the H-1B visa fee structure, raising the cost of applying for an H-1B visa to USD 100,000. This fee increase, as outlined by the White House, is part of an ongoing effort to fund border security and reduce visa fraud. These changes will have a significant impact on employers and foreign workers, especially those in industries that rely on specialized talent from abroad. The most notable change is the substantial hike in the base filing fee for H-1B applications. Employers will now face a USD 100,000 fee to sponsor foreign workers; a sharp increase compared to previous years (USD 1,000). A portion of this fee will go toward funding fraud detection and border security efforts. Non-profit organizations and educational institutions may still be eligible for reduced fees, but for-profit businesses will be subject to the full USD 100,000 fee, which could influence their decision to sponsor H-1B workers. As these changes affect both employers and workers, it’s important to understand how the new fees impact your situation. WINHELLER can help you understand these updates and provide the guidance you need to manage the process effectively. Can I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Unlike many other visas, including the H-2B visa, the H-1B visa does not require the applicant to prove that he or she has no immigration intentions or that he or she will maintain a foreign residence. Accordingly, without this being a disadvantage to him or her as a matter of law, the applicant may file a green card petition while working in the U.S. on a H-1B visa. Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may apply for an H-4 visa to accompany the applicant. Albeit, they are not allowed to then work. There is, however, one important exception to this rule: If an I-140 petition has been approved for the H-1B visa holder, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for work authorization. H-2B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa\nThe H-2B visa category is intended for non-agricultural employees seeking to work in the U.S. temporarily. H-2B visa for German nationals\nSince December 18, 2012, only nationals of certain countries are eligible to apply for an H-2B visa. For a long time, German nationals were not eligible, unlike nationals from many other EU countries, including Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Spain. However, as of January 30, 2018, Germans nationals are eligible for an H-2B visa. Other nationals currently eligible for an H-2B visa are listed below."

It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation.

However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

For example, in addition to the usual Nonimmigrant Visa\nApplication (form DS-156), all nonimmigrant visa applicants over the age of 16 must also complete and\nsubmit the Supplemental Nonimmigrant Visa Application (form DS-157). This form is required of all\napplicants, regardless of nationality and regardless of where the applicant applies. The consular post will conduct an initial review of the application and related documentation and clarify\nany outstanding questions during a subsequent interview.1 In general, an applicant must be able to\ndemonstrate his or her intention to enter the United States for a temporary period and solely for the purpose\nof tourism and/or short-term business. The applicant must also provide evidence of financial ability to\ncover his or her travel expenses to/from and stay in the United States. Finally, he or she must demonstrate\nsufficiently strong social, economic, and other ties to compel the applicant to return to China after the\ntemporary and lawful visit to the U.S. In addition to the documentation listed below, please be advised that, since March 2004, the U.S. Embassy\nin Beijing has been collecting biometric identifiers such as fingerprints from all nonimmigrant visa\napplicants. This is related to the U.S. implementation of requirements for machine-readable passports,\nnewer “biometric” passports that contain an identifying marker such as a fingerprint scan, and U.S. visas\nthat contain a biometric indicator. A massive new database, the US-VISIT entry and exit control system,\nhas also been introduced at major American border crossings. These measures help to increase the security\nof travel documents and help to ensure that the document holder is a legitimate traveler. 1\nA nonimmigrant visa applicant who has previously traveled to the U.S. using a B-type visa that (1) expired less than one year ago\nand (2) who is applying for the same type of visa, may drop his/her visa application and application fee receipt at a U.S. Consulate for\nadjudication.

The applicant must meet the **educational requirements** (degree or equivalent practical experience). 4. The employer must file a **Labor Condition Application (LCA)** with the US Department of Labor. 5. The employer must file **Form I-129** (H-1B petition). 6.

Purpose of visit must be **temporary**. 2. Show ability to **pay expenses**. 3. Show strong home-country ties. 4. No intent to work. USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."

Offered salary\n\nIf the offered salary is **lower than the prevailing wage**, the petition is usually denied or requires correction. ---\n\n## 7. Required Information to Determine if Salary Is Enough\n\nFor ANY salary-eligibility question, the assistant must ask or check:\n\n### Mandatory:\n\n* **Job location (city/state)**\n* **Job title**\n* **Job duties (brief)**\n* **Experience required**\n* **Degree field**\n* **Salary offered**\n\n## 1. Why Salary Matters for H-1B\n\nFor H-1B visas, the employer must pay at least the **“actual wage”** or the **“prevailing wage”**, whichever is higher. * Actual wage: what current employees in similar positions earn at the same employer. * Prevailing wage: set by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) based on job location, SOC code, experience level (Level 1–4). Because prevailing wages vary significantly by geography, industry, and job level, there is **no fixed universal wage threshold**. Instead we can reason using **salary bands**. ---\n\n## 2. Salary Band Guidelines (for Software / Engineering / Common Tech Jobs)\n\nThese bands are approximate, meant to help eligibility reasoning. They are not legal thresholds. | **Band** | **Approx Annual Salary (USD, before tax)** | **Likely Corresponding Settings** |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Low Band** | ≈ 70,000 – 90,000 | Entry-level Software Engineer/Developer in low-to-mid cost regions; Level-1–2 wage levels. |\n| **Mid Band** | ≈ 90,000 – 120,000 | Junior-to-mid-level roles in mid-cost metro areas; Level-2 or low Level-3. |\n| **Upper-Mid Band** | ≈ 120,000 – 150,000 | Mid-to-senior roles in moderately expensive cities; Level-3 wage level. |\n| **High Band** | ≈ 150,000 – 200,000 | Senior / specialized roles, in high-cost metro areas (e.g., coastal tech hubs), Level-3/4. |\n| **Top Band** | > 200,000 | Senior/lead/architect/manager roles in high-cost metro regions or high-demand specialties; Level-4. |\n\n> **Important caveats:**\n>\n> * These bands are **guidelines**, not legal minima. > * Final wage eligibility depends on **job location, SOC code, required level, employer pay scales, benefits**. > * For low-band wages, acceptance depends on **low cost-of-living area** and verifying employer’s “actual wage.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. When Low or Mid-Band Might Be Accepted\n\nH-1B may still be approved at **low or mid-band** wages if:\n\n* Job location is in a **low or mid-cost area** (lower prevailing wage). * Role is **entry-level or junior** (Level 1 or 2). * Employer’s “actual wage” to similar staff is in that range (not just minimum). * The job duties match entry-level complexity (not senior/architect-level). * Employer provides proper documentation (LCA, wage attestation). In such cases, $75,000–85,000 in a small or mid-cost city could be valid; but in high-cost cities $100,000 might be borderline. ---\n\n## 4. When Wage Must Be Upper-Mid or Higher\n\nWage should be in **Upper-Mid / High / Top Band** if:\n\n* Job location is a **high-cost metro** (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles)."

          "text": "# 🇺🇸 **H-1B Salary & Specialty Occupation Rules (Clean, Accurate, No Hallucination)**\n\n## 1. Overview\n\nThe H-1B visa requires the employer to:\n\n* Offer a **specialty occupation** job. * Pay at least the **prevailing wage**. * Ensure the beneficiary meets all **qualification criteria**. This document provides general rules used by USCIS and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). It does **not** contain exact wage numbers (because they vary by location and change yearly). ---\n\n## 2. What Counts as a Specialty Occupation\n\nA job qualifies as a specialty occupation if **any** of the following are true:\n\n1. **A bachelor’s degree or higher (or equivalent experience) is normally the minimum requirement** for the occupation. 2. The degree requirement is **common within the industry** for similar positions. 3. The employer normally requires a degree for that role. 4. The specific duties are so specialized and complex that a bachelor’s degree is required. ### Common Specialty Occupation Fields\n\nThese commonly qualify:\n\n* Software Engineer, Developer, Programmer\n* IT Analyst, Systems Analyst\n* Data Scientist, ML/AI roles\n* Electrical/Mechanical/Computer Engineer\n* Accountants (with specific criteria)\n* Financial analysts\n* Architects\n* Medical professionals\n* University-level researchers\n* Specialty managers (if degree-related)\n\n### Minimum Educational Requirement\n\n* U.S. **Bachelor’s degree** or foreign **equivalent** (evaluated). * Or **12 years of experience** = equivalent to bachelor’s (3 years = 1 year of degree)\n* Degree must be **directly related** to the job field. ---\n\n## 3. SOC Codes Commonly Used\n\nSoftware-related occupations typically fall under:\n\n* **15-1252 Software Developers**\n* **15-1256 Software QA/Testers**\n* **15-1211 Computer Systems Analysts**\n* **15-1221 Data Scientists**\n\nThese SOC codes determine prevailing wage levels. ---\n\n## 4. Prevailing Wage Requirement (General Rules)\n\n### The employer must pay **the higher of**:\n\n* The **actual wage** paid to similar employees at the company, OR\n* The **prevailing wage** determined by DOL for that **occupation + location + level**. ### Factors that affect prevailing wage:\n\n1. **Job location (city/county/MSA)**\n\n * Large tech hubs have higher wages. 2. **Wage Level (1–4)** based on:\n\n * Required experience\n * Job complexity\n * Level of supervision\n3. **SOC code**\n\n### General Wage Level Meaning (Conceptual Only)\n\n* **Level 1 (Entry)** – Basic tasks, close supervision. * **Level 2 (Qualified)** – Moderate experience. * **Level 3 (Experienced)** – Advanced duties. * **Level 4 (Expert)** – Complex, leadership-level. ---\n\n## 5. General Salary Expectations (Safe, Non-Numeric Range Explanation)\n\nTo avoid hallucinating any specific wage values, the following are **accurate generalizations**:\n\n* In **high-cost cities** (e.g., San Francisco, NYC, Seattle), prevailing wages for software roles are **significantly higher** than in mid-cost areas. * In **mid-cost cities** (Austin, Denver, Atlanta), Level-1 wages for software roles are **moderate** and can be met by many early-career salaries. * In **low-cost areas**, Level-1 wages are **lower**, and even lower salaries may suffice. ### Key point for your chatbot:\n\n**A salary cannot be evaluated without the location AND job level. **\n\n---\n\n## 6.

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years."

United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

          "text": "UK VISA SCREENING – DOCUMENT CHECKLIST AND GUIDANCE (2025)\nSource basis: This guide is based primarily on the official UK government guidance for the\nStudent visa “Documents you’ll need to apply” and related pages (tuberculosis testing,\nEnglish language evidence, ATAS) together with checklists published by UK universities and\nadvisory organisations. It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening”\npurposes and is not a legal document. Always cross‑check with the latest guidance on\nGOV.UK before applying. ------------------------------------------------------------\n1. INTRODUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you apply for a UK Student visa, the decision maker (UK Visas and Immigration –\nUKVI) checks that you:\n- are a genuine student with an unconditional offer;\n- will study an approved course at a licensed sponsor;\n- can support yourself financially and pay your tuition fees;\n- meet health and character requirements; and\n- have provided all mandatory supporting documents. This checking process is often called visa “screening”. If any required evidence is missing or\ndoes not meet the format rules, UKVI can refuse the application even if you are otherwise\neligible. This document is designed as a training resource for building a UK visa‑screening\nsystem: it expands the official document list into a detailed, structured checklist that a\nsystem can use to verify whether the applicant has collected the correct evidence. The guide focuses on the standard Student visa route (for courses longer than 6 months)\nmade from outside the UK. Many of the requirements are also relevant to applications made\nwithin the UK, but some details differ. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE MANDATORY DOCUMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Current passport or travel document\nEvery applicant must provide a valid passport or other travel document. Key screening points:\n- The document must be valid on the date you submit the application and when you travel\nto the UK. - It should contain at least one blank page (front and back) so the visa vignette can be\nplaced in it if an eVisa is not used. - The personal details page must be clearly readable and not damaged. - If the passport will expire very soon after arrival, applicants are strongly advised to renew\nit before applying, because replacing a passport from abroad can be difficult. Evidence format:\n- Original physical passport (for in‑person biometrics) or electronic copy if applying using\nthe UK Immigration ID Check app. - If you hold more than one nationality, you may need to declare and provide details of all\npassports. 2.2 Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\nThe second mandatory document is a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) issued\nby a licensed Student sponsor (usually your university or college). The CAS is an electronic\nrecord, not a paper letter, but universities often provide a CAS statement for your reference. Key screening points:\n- CAS reference number: you must enter this correctly in the online application form. - The CAS must be issued by a sponsor with a valid Student sponsor licence."

You may not study after entering on\na visitor (B) visa, unless you are eligible for and have\nobtained a change of status from USCIS, or through the\nVisa Waiver Program (VWP), except to undertake\nrecreational (non-credit) study as part of a tourist visit.

The\nSEVP-approved school will issue you a Form I-20. After you\nreceive the Form I-20 and register in SEVIS, you may apply\nat a U.S. Embassy or Consulate for a student (F or M) visa. You must present the Form I-20 to the consular officer when\nyou attend your visa interview. If your spouse and/or children will live with you in the\nUnited States while you study, they must also enroll in\nSEVIS, obtain individual Form I-20s from the SEVP-approved\nschool, and apply for a visa (but they do not pay the SEVIS\nfee).

ACADEMIC, ENGLISH AND STUDY‑PLAN EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n5.1 Admission letter and academic documents\nAlthough the primary official record of admission is the I‑20 or DS‑2019, students usually\nbring:\n- University admission or offer letter. - Academic transcripts and diplomas (school, college, previous university). - Standardized test scores (such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT) if required by\nthe school. These documents help show that the student is academically prepared. Screening checks:\n- The course details in the admission letter are consistent with the I‑20 (program name,\nlevel, start date). - Academic history in DS‑160 matches the transcripts and qualifications supplied. - Any gaps in education or work history are explained. 5.2 English‑language ability\nFor most academic programs, U.S. schools set minimum English‑language requirements. The consular officer may also informally evaluate English during the interview. Poor\nlanguage ability may raise doubts about whether the student can follow the course and\nwhether the offer of admission is genuine. A screening engine can:\n- Record test names, scores, and test dates. - Compare scores with program requirements. - Flag missing or expired English‑language evidence for schools that normally require it. 5.3 Study plans and career goals\nDuring the interview, officers often ask why the applicant chose that particular course,\nuniversity and country, and how the education fits into their long‑term plans. There is no\nseparate document for this, but consistency between the personal statement provided to\nthe university, DS‑160 answers, and interview responses is crucial. From a visa‑screening perspective, large mismatches (for example, weak academic history\nbut very expensive, unrelated course with vague career plan) may signal higher refusal risk. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6. NONIMMIGRANT INTENT AND TIES TO HOME COUNTRY (INA 214(b))\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, most nonimmigrant visa\napplicants are presumed to be intending immigrants unless they can convince the officer\nthat they will respect the terms of their visa and leave the U.S. or change status lawfully at\nthe end of their permitted stay. For students, this means demonstrating both:\n- A credible plan to study full‑time and follow status rules; and\n- Strong connections (“ties”) outside the U.S. that make it likely they will leave after study,\nsuch as family responsibilities, career prospects, property, or business. 6.1 Typical “ties” evidence\nApplicants may bring informal supporting documents such as:\n- Evidence of family living in the home country (family registers, residence documents). - Proof of owned property or long‑term tenancy. - Letters from employers noting future job opportunities after graduation. - Business registration certificates or partnership documents. - Previous international travel history showing they respected visa rules in other countries. These documents are not always requested, but they can help in borderline cases."

Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

These documents must be original or properly certified copies. If they are not in English or\nWelsh, an official translated version must also be provided. ------------------------------------------------------------\n7. PREVIOUS SPONSORSHIP CONSENT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nIf, in the last 12 months, you were financially sponsored by a government or an\ninternational scholarship agency for both tuition fees and living costs, and that sponsorship\nhas ended, you must provide a letter from that sponsor giving you unconditional consent to\nremain or re‑enter the UK for further study. The consent letter should:\n- Be on official letterhead;\n- Include your full name and, ideally, your date of birth or passport number;\n- Confirm that the sponsor supports your new course in the UK and has no objection to your\nvisa application; and\n- Be signed, dated and include contact information of an authorised official. Screening rule:\n- If an applicant declares previous full sponsorship, the file must contain this consent letter. Without it, the visa can be refused even if financial funds are otherwise sufficient. ------------------------------------------------------------\n8. ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDepending on your level of study and nationality, you may be required to submit academic\nqualifications listed on your CAS. 8.1 When qualifications are required\n- If you are studying below degree level and are not from a “differential evidence” country,\nyou must normally submit the qualification documents used to obtain your offer (for\nexample, school certificates, college transcripts). - If you are from a differential evidence country or studying at degree level or above, you\nmay not have to upload documents with your application, but you must keep them ready\nbecause UKVI can request them during screening. Common types of academic evidence:\n- Certificates of qualification (for example, 12th grade mark sheet, bachelor’s degree\ncertificate);\n- Official transcripts of results, stamped or sealed by the institution;\n- Printouts of results from an awarding body’s secure online verification system. Screening checks:\n- Do the qualification names and grades match the details in the CAS? - Are documents genuine‑looking (correct logos, spelling, signatures, seals)? - If any document is not in English or Welsh, is a certified translation attached? ------------------------------------------------------------\n9. TRANSLATIONS AND DOCUMENT FORMAT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny supporting document that is not in English or Welsh must be accompanied by a fully\ncertified translation. The translation must:\n- Be done by a professional translator or translation company;\n- Include confirmation that it is an accurate translation of the original document;\n- Include the date of translation;\n- Include the translator’s or translation company’s full name and contact details; and\n- Bear the translator’s signature. Screening checks:\n- For every non‑English/Welsh document, confirm that a corresponding translation is\npresent and meets the above requirements."

Medical or travel insurance\nEvidence of medical or travel insurance does not need to be provided with your application. However, the Visa Officer may request it before they make a decision on your application. If your visa is approved, you must have evidence of medical or travel insurance when you arrive at the port of entry (airport or seaport) and must present it to the Immigration Officer on request. 10. Previous Visa Refusals\nIf you have been refused a visa in the past for any country, you must provide the details. The original letter issued to you by the authorities of that country must be provided with your application. Please note: Not disclosing any previous visa refusals will result in your application being refused. Visa applications on behalf of a child (person under 18)\nIf a child under the age of 18 is travelling, their birth certificate must be submitted with their application. Letter of consent\nIf they are travelling either alone or with a person other than their parent or legal guardian (for example, an adult relative, nurse), a written letter of consent from both parents or legal guardians is required. These signed consents must be accompanied by copies of the consenting parent or legal guardians’ passports or national identity cards, which clearly show their signature. If the child is travelling with one parent or legal guardian, the consent of the other parent or legal guardian is required. This signed consent must be accompanied by a copy of the consenting parent or legal guardian’s passport or national identity card which clearly shows their signature. Court order\nWhere one parent has sole custody, a Court Order bestowing sole custody of the child on the parent concerned must be submitted."

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes). SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."

          "text": "Before the employer can file its petition for the applicant with the immigration authorities, they must file what is known as a Labor Condition Attestation (LCA) with the U.S. Department of Labor. This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter. The maximum stay may not exceed six years."

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years."

Why Salary Matters for H-1B\n\nFor H-1B visas, the employer must pay at least the **“actual wage”** or the **“prevailing wage”**, whichever is higher. * Actual wage: what current employees in similar positions earn at the same employer. * Prevailing wage: set by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) based on job location, SOC code, experience level (Level 1–4). Because prevailing wages vary significantly by geography, industry, and job level, there is **no fixed universal wage threshold**. Instead we can reason using **salary bands**. ---\n\n## 2. Salary Band Guidelines (for Software / Engineering / Common Tech Jobs)\n\nThese bands are approximate, meant to help eligibility reasoning. They are not legal thresholds. | **Band** | **Approx Annual Salary (USD, before tax)** | **Likely Corresponding Settings** |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Low Band** | ≈ 70,000 – 90,000 | Entry-level Software Engineer/Developer in low-to-mid cost regions; Level-1–2 wage levels. |\n| **Mid Band** | ≈ 90,000 – 120,000 | Junior-to-mid-level roles in mid-cost metro areas; Level-2 or low Level-3. |\n| **Upper-Mid Band** | ≈ 120,000 – 150,000 | Mid-to-senior roles in moderately expensive cities; Level-3 wage level. |\n| **High Band** | ≈ 150,000 – 200,000 | Senior / specialized roles, in high-cost metro areas (e.g., coastal tech hubs), Level-3/4. |\n| **Top Band** | > 200,000 | Senior/lead/architect/manager roles in high-cost metro regions or high-demand specialties; Level-4. |\n\n> **Important caveats:**\n>\n> * These bands are **guidelines**, not legal minima. > * Final wage eligibility depends on **job location, SOC code, required level, employer pay scales, benefits**. > * For low-band wages, acceptance depends on **low cost-of-living area** and verifying employer’s “actual wage.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. When Low or Mid-Band Might Be Accepted\n\nH-1B may still be approved at **low or mid-band** wages if:\n\n* Job location is in a **low or mid-cost area** (lower prevailing wage). * Role is **entry-level or junior** (Level 1 or 2). * Employer’s “actual wage” to similar staff is in that range (not just minimum). * The job duties match entry-level complexity (not senior/architect-level). * Employer provides proper documentation (LCA, wage attestation). In such cases, $75,000–85,000 in a small or mid-cost city could be valid; but in high-cost cities $100,000 might be borderline. ---\n\n## 4. When Wage Must Be Upper-Mid or Higher\n\nWage should be in **Upper-Mid / High / Top Band** if:\n\n* Job location is a **high-cost metro** (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles)."

          "text": "H-1B Visa - Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nAdvice on The H-1B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa For Highly Skilled Workers\nThe H-1B visa is for workers who wish to work in a U.S. company for a limited period of time. The advantage of this visa category is that, in contrast to the L visa and the E visa, there are no special requirements for the U.S. company. The requirements for the applicant are also much fewer; in particular, the applicant is not required to hold a managerial position in the U.S. company. The disadvantage of the H-1B visa is that the number of visas issued per year is usually limited in quantity. It is therefore advisable to first check whether a different visa might be considered. There is no limit on the number of people who wish to work for universities or for nonprofit or certain government-related research institutions. Contents on this page:\n\nWhat qualifications do applicants need to have? What are the requirements for the workplace? What is the application process? What is the H-1B quota system? What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nCan I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? What qualifications do applicants need to have? The basic requirement for the H-1B visa is that the applicant must have a U.S. bachelor's degree or a foreign graduate degree at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. Several years of work experience or a combination of both may also qualify an applicant for an H-1B visa. In addition, the H-1B visa can also be applied for by models who usually do not have a university degree in their field. If the applicant earned his or her degree from a foreign educational institution, he or she must demonstrate that the degree is at least equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree. There are various service providers in the USA who can carry out such an evaluation and issue a corresponding certificate recognized by the immigration authorities (keyword: \"foreign credential evaluation\"). Persons who have obtained a Master's degree at a university in the USA may benefit from the fact that a certain quota of H-1B work visas is reserved for persons with this type of degree. What are the requirements for the workplace? When applying for an H-1B visa, as with all other visas, it must be proven that a specific job offer from the USA exists. In this context, the offered job must require the applicant's special skills, i.e. in particular the U.S. bachelor's degree. The anticipated salary must not be less than the amount paid to employees with comparable experience and qualifications, and the recruitment of the applicant must not have an adverse effect on that group of employees. Last but not least, there must not be a strike at the company where the applicant is to be employed."

Facilitation of travel\nThe following section assesses the achievement of the Visitor Visa Program’s facilitation objective. To assess this objective, the evaluation examined the extent to which the visa application process\nfacilitates travel, in comparison to other countries, and the impact of visa requirement changes on\ntravel patterns. This section also presents some mechanisms and tools that aim to facilitate travel to\nCanada for bona fide visitors. 33\nFinding: CIC’s Visitor Visa Program facilitates the movement of bona fide travellers, as evidenced\nby the fact that the TRV processing requirements are similar to those in other countries; by\nreaching CIC targets for approval rates; and by introducing other facilitative approaches and tools. Processing requirements\nThe visitor visa process and processing requirements can be a travel barrier if the process is not\ntimely and the requirements are more extensive than those used by other countries. Canada has\nfaced criticism from stakeholders, such as the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC), regarding the\nextensive information requirements. In 2010, CIC conducted an internally-led comparison study of\nthe TRV application processes and requirements between Canada and other countries competing\nfor international tourists. Information was gathered and analysed for the American, British, French\nand Australian visitor visa programs in certain key locations comparing processes and requirements\nfor nationals of China, India and Brazil. The study showed that Canada collected more information\nthan the other countries reviewed (see Table 3-6). It has the highest number of fields to be\ncompleted by applicants. Also, some information requested varies between different Canadian visa\noffices. For example, Details of Past Work Experience and Details of Travel History were not\nsystematically requested by visa officers in all missions. On the other hand, Canada asked a similar\nnumber of security questions as other countries and requests a similar number of supporting\ndocuments.

Program background\nUnder the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), every foreign national travelling to Canada\nmust have a temporary resident visa (TRV) before arriving, except where an exception is granted to\ncitizens of selected countries under section 1902 of the IRP Regulations. A foreign national who wishes to come to Canada from a visa-required country needs to apply for\na TRV at a Canadian visa office abroad (CVOA). If the application is accepted, the TRV is issued to\nthe applicant in their travel document and they may travel to Canada, subject to the determination\nof entry by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) personnel at a port of entry (POE). There are many potential benefits that result from the temporary migration of foreign visitors to\nCanada, such as the development and growth of the tourism industry, increases to trade and\ninternational understanding, and cultural exchanges. While Canada may benefit from international\ntravel, it may also be exposed to risks ranging from the potential spread of infectious diseases,\nadmission of persons who pose a safety or security risk, transnational crime, and human trafficking. Canada assesses countries against several criteria and risk factors when deciding whether to lift or\nimpose a visa requirement. From 2002 to 2012, visa exemptions were extended to nine countries,\n2 Section 190 of the IRP Regulations identifies which countries do not require a visa to enter Canada. In addition,\npersons described in R39 and holders of Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) are also exempted from the TRV\nrequirement; however, those exemptions are outside the scope of this evaluation. 1\nwhile visa requirements were introduced for five countries. Citizens of 55 countries and territories\nare currently visa-exempt for travel to Canada, while citizens of 142 countries and territories are\nvisa-required. For the countries for which a visitor visa is required, the processing of visitor visa applications from\npersons intending to travel to Canada is carried out by CIC in the missions abroad, in cooperation\nwith its federal partners. In total, there are 86 offices with CIC presence abroad in 72 countries;\ncurrently 64 are processing visitor visa applications. In 2010, CIC processed applications from over\none million persons seeking temporary resident visas as tourists and business visitors to Canada,\nand issued visitor visas, permits and extensions to around 865,000 persons. Visitor Visa Program\nThe following sections describe the key activities and outcomes of the Visitor Visa Program (see\nTechnical appendices) stemming from the two components of the Program: policy and\nimplementation."

Any temporary visitor who pursues other activities is in direct conflict\nwith conditions of admission, which undermines the integrity of the immigration program. Due to the weaknesses of the data collection system, it is not possible to assess the number of\npeople who remain in Canada longer than authorized (overstays), those who engage in illegal work\nwhile under temporary visitor status, or those that apply for permanent residence while in the\ncountry. While CIC considers these indicators relevant to measure irregular migration as described\nin its PAA, Canada and many other peer countries do not have exit control systems, so it is difficult\nto know how many people remain in the country when their period of authorized stay ends. In\n2008, the Auditor General report estimated that there were 63,000 people with enforceable\nremoval orders in Canada; however, since there is no information on who has left the country, the\nnumber of illegal migrants may be higher. The report stated that Canada does not monitor the exit of\ntravellers from the country, and therefore (..) does not know whether individuals have left the country as required in their\ntemporary permit.18\n18 Auditor General Report, Chapter 5 – Citizenship and Immigration Canada – Control and Enforcement. www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/English/parl_oag_200304_05_e_12911.html\n27\nImmigration violations\nImmigration violations are documented infractions of Canadian immigration laws, such as\ninterceptions of individuals en route to Canada, of inadmissible individuals identified at a Canadian\nport of entry and those identified in Canada.

Another risk\nis that people with health risks will either directly impact the health of Canadians (e.g. through the\nspread of tuberculosis) or will constitute a drain on public health services (e.g. through treatment\nfor chronic illnesses or conditions).

Those studying in Italy must also obtain a residency permit. Getting a visa to study in Germany requires proof you have the funds: an average student needs to live on - €853 per month.

Is there anything else I need to apply for a Schengen student visa? If you are a student at an institution in your home country, planning to travel to the Schengen Area to study for a period, you may want to get a no objection letter from officials at your university. This is a short letter stating that they have ‘no objection’ to you traveling as they expect you to return to your studies after your trip. It can help with your visa application as it helps confirm that you will not overstay your Schengen student visa. You should ask someone in a position of responsibility for this. How much time does it get to obtain a Schengen student visa? The processing of your application will take six to eight weeks. We advise you to apply well in advance of the proposed beginning of your studies. Can I work while I study? Working while in a country on a student visa is against the law without securing an employment visa from your host government. Therefore, you can combine studying with work. For example, in France, the law authorizes foreign students to work 964 hours, which corresponds to 60 percent of normal working hours. However, part-time work will not be sufficient to cover all your expenses and should be considered as a secondary source of income. Violating these rules could seriously jeopardize your studies and future employment prospects, as breaking local immigration laws may result in a travel ban. Where do I obtain the form to apply for a Student Visa? A Student Schengen Visa form should be available from the website of the consulate of the country or visa application center you are applying to visit. For example, Indian students who apply for a Student visa in Germany will find the information here: india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2288440#content_0\n\nCan I extend a Schengen student visa? A Schengen student visa can be extended only in some very specific cases, such as late entry, humanitarian reasons, important personal reasons, or some kind of unforeseeable circumstances. You cannot extend your Schengen student visa for the purpose of continuing your studies. If you do wish to continue your studies beyond the original period planned, you will have to return to your home country or country of residence and apply for a long-stay study visa.

PRO-BUSINESS TIP: Don’t worry, AXA can gladly help you wrap your head around the 90/180 Schengen visa rule too. Do I need a Schengen Business visa? That depends. Generally speaking, if you’re one of the 5-6 billion nationals of over 100 countries worldwide that don't have a visa-free agreement with the Schengen Area, you’ll need a Schengen visa to enter most of Europe–be it for business or anything else. And if you’re trying to enter Europe for professional reasons (i.e., to buy, sell, attend meetings and/or conferences, sign contracts, network at trade shows, and so on), the visa you apply for is going to have to be… You guessed it: a business Schengen visa. Also keep in mind that if you only plan to stay in Europe for a few days, a visa is still most likely required. And the same goes for even if your company (or employer, client, etc.) is footing the bill for your trip. But but more on that below! PRO-BUSINESS TIPS: And fear not! AXA can help you figure out who needs a Schengen visa and who doesn’t need a Schengen visa in no time too. IMPORTANT PRO-TIP: Meanwhile, if you're from a country whose citizens don’t need a Schengen visa (i.e., Canada, the U.K., the U.S., and roughly 60 more), you typically should be ok for short business trips under 90 days. However, you’ll still likely need at least some paperwork attesting to the trip’s “business” nature. In other words, whether you need that visa or not, it’s still always best to check with the authorities (i.e., consulates and/or embassies) of the specific Schengen state you plan to visit beforehand. What Are the Main Requirements for a Business Schengen Visa Application? Along with meeting the general requirements for a Schengen visa, you must also prove that your trip is for genuine business activities (i.e., attending meetings, conferences, trade shows, and so on). And depending on your particular situation–as well as the specific Schengen authorities–this proof can be in the form of an invitation and/or sponsorship letter (see below! ), a conference registration, a meeting agenda, a contract or other official business-related documents, and the like. Which documents do I need to provide for a Business Schengen Visa? You’ll also, at the very least, likely need the following:\n\nCompleted and signed Schengen visa application form\nTwo passport-sized photos (matching Schengen visa photo requirements)\nProof of Schengen travel medical insurance (PRO-BUSINESS TIP: Proper travel insurance is mandatory to be granted a Schengen visa and all of AXA’s plans are proper indeed!) Your flight itinerary\n​​Proof of accommodation (if applicable)\nProof of means of subsistence (if applicable)\nWhat documents do I need from my company or business partner for the application? Your company or business partner must indeed provide at least some official documentation to support your application."

          "text": "Discover AXA Schengen Annual\n\nWhat is a Schengen work visa and how do I get one? I’m planning to work in Europe, do I need a Schengen work visa? There’s no such thing as a ’Schengen work visa’. You can only work in Schengen nations for long periods if you have a National D-type Work visa, which is issued by the country you are planning to work in - and will not entitle you to work in another state. However, if you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work reasons and your trip will last fewer than 90 days, then you can apply for a short-stay Schengen work visa allowing you to fulfill your business obligations. You will need to provide evidence that work is the purpose of your trip to be issued with a short-stay visa equivalent to the length of your posting in your desired Schengen Area. You must leave your host country before the expiry date shown on your visa. If your obligations exceed 90 days, you need a long-stay work visa type D. You may also need to validate it within three months following your arrival. What different types of Schengen visas exist ? How do I get a European work permit? To get a European work visa you need to check the employment visas offered in the country where you wish to work and figure out if you qualify. Meet the criteria, collect the required documents for an employment visa and schedule a visa interview. What documents do I need to obtain a short-stay Schengen work visa? If you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work purposes, for example, to represent your company or to meet with investors, suppliers, or potential clients or customers, you need a letter of invitation, specifying your business relationship and what you will be doing during the time you are in the country. It is a good idea for you to attach an itinerary of the business activities to the invitation letter so you can show your work plans. If you are an employee, you should also include documentation from your employer confirming that you are an employee and details of your work. These should include your job position, dates of employment, salary, and why you must travel for business purposes. It may also be a good idea to get a no objection letter from your employer in your home country. If self-employed, you will need to provide a copy of your business license, a company bank statement for the last six months, and an income tax return. From the end of 2023, citizens of countries with a visa-free arrangement for short stays in the Schengen Area will need to apply via the ETIAS system for short business trips. If you plan to work aboard for longer, you will need to apply for a national work visa. Is a work visa difficult to obtain?"

Financial Requirements / Proof of Means\n\n* **No single EU-wide fixed bank balance** is mandated; consulates evaluate whether the applicant has sufficient means for the duration and purpose of visit. * Acceptable evidence includes: recent bank statements, salary slips, sponsorship letter (formal obligation by host), confirmed paid hotel reservation, prepaid tours, or proof of financial sponsorship. * Typical practice: consulates look for bank statements covering the **last 3 months** and at least modest, proportional funds relative to the trip length and destination cost-of-living. * If invited/sponsored, a **formal obligation** or invitation letter combined with sponsor’s bank proof may replace applicant funds. ---\n\n## 4. Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules.

It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation.

However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

          "text": "Introduction\nAll individuals who apply at a Consulate or Embassy abroad for a United States entry or re-entry visa are\nscreened before the visa is issued, regardless of nationality. The U.S. has strict visa laws because it is an\nopen society. Unlike many other countries, the nation does not impose internal controls such as registration\nwith local authorities on its visitors. Yet, in order to enjoy the privilege of unencumbered travel in the U.S.,\ncertain requirements must be met. In particular, a foreign traveler has a responsibility to prove that he or she is going to return home from\ntravel abroad before a visitor visa will be issued. U.S. consular officers are required by law to view every\nvisa applicant as an intending immigrant until the applicant proves otherwise. Section 214(b) of the U.S.\nImmigration and Naturalization Act states: “Every alien shall presumed to be an immigrant until he\nestablishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is\nentitled to a nonimmigrant status.” Though the actual approval rate for first time visa applicants processed\nduring 2004 through the U.S. Embassy in Beijing remains near 70%, most of those visa applications that\nwere denied were refused under the terms of Section 214(b). More information: American Embassy in Beijing Page 4\nhttp://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/visa\n2 U.S. Visa Types for Business Travel\nThe United States issues two types of visas: Immigrant and Nonimmigrant. Within the nonimmigrant classification, multiple types of visa classes exist. “B” type visa referrals are\nappropriate for standardization experts from the People’s Republic of China who are invited to the U.S. to\nparticipate in either a meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) or the International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO), or for those who are invited by U.S. firms as temporary visitors for\nbusiness. Visa Class – Type “B” Purpose of Travel\nB1 Temporary visitor for business\nB2 Temporary visitor for pleasure\nB1/B2 Temporary visitor for business or pleasure\n[NOTE: For a complete list of visa classes, please see Annex A of this document.] The B1 visa is intended for temporary business travel. This includes such travel as for the purpose of\nnegotiating contracts, attending exhibitions and conferences, short-term training, and consultations with\nsuppliers and customers. The B1 visa is not valid for employment in the U.S. The B2 visa is intended for tourist activities, such as sightseeing, visiting friends and relatives, obtaining\nmedical treatment, and attending non-vocational conferences and meetings. Visitors are not permitted to\naccept employment during their stay in the U.S. B2 visas are valid for one entry within three months of the\nissuance date. In some instances, a consular officer may elect to issue a B1 visa jointly with a B2 visa type. Generally, a\nB1/B2 visa means that while in the U.S. as a business visitor, an individual may attend meetings, and\nparticipate in them fully, conduct research, and engage in other business negotations."

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years."

USA — Visa eligibility reference (work, study, visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis document summarizes the main eligibility rules, required evidence, and common evaluation points for U.S. non-immigrant visas commonly used by applicants: H-1B (work - specialty occupation), F-1 (student), J-1 (exchange), and short stay (B-1/B-2). Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."

          "text": "- Use of documents from unregulated banks or unverifiable financial institutions. - Over‑reliance on funds that are not easily accessible (for example, property valuations\nwithout a loan or sale). - Financial stories that conflict with the student’s stated background or DS‑160 answers. ------------------------------------------------------------\n5. ACADEMIC, ENGLISH AND STUDY‑PLAN EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n5.1 Admission letter and academic documents\nAlthough the primary official record of admission is the I‑20 or DS‑2019, students usually\nbring:\n- University admission or offer letter. - Academic transcripts and diplomas (school, college, previous university). - Standardized test scores (such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT) if required by\nthe school. These documents help show that the student is academically prepared. Screening checks:\n- The course details in the admission letter are consistent with the I‑20 (program name,\nlevel, start date). - Academic history in DS‑160 matches the transcripts and qualifications supplied. - Any gaps in education or work history are explained. 5.2 English‑language ability\nFor most academic programs, U.S. schools set minimum English‑language requirements. The consular officer may also informally evaluate English during the interview. Poor\nlanguage ability may raise doubts about whether the student can follow the course and\nwhether the offer of admission is genuine. A screening engine can:\n- Record test names, scores, and test dates. - Compare scores with program requirements. - Flag missing or expired English‑language evidence for schools that normally require it. 5.3 Study plans and career goals\nDuring the interview, officers often ask why the applicant chose that particular course,\nuniversity and country, and how the education fits into their long‑term plans. There is no\nseparate document for this, but consistency between the personal statement provided to\nthe university, DS‑160 answers, and interview responses is crucial. From a visa‑screening perspective, large mismatches (for example, weak academic history\nbut very expensive, unrelated course with vague career plan) may signal higher refusal risk. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6. NONIMMIGRANT INTENT AND TIES TO HOME COUNTRY (INA 214(b))\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, most nonimmigrant visa\napplicants are presumed to be intending immigrants unless they can convince the officer\nthat they will respect the terms of their visa and leave the U.S. or change status lawfully at\nthe end of their permitted stay. For students, this means demonstrating both:\n- A credible plan to study full‑time and follow status rules; and\n- Strong connections (“ties”) outside the U.S. that make it likely they will leave after study,\nsuch as family responsibilities, career prospects, property, or business. 6.1 Typical “ties” evidence\nApplicants may bring informal supporting documents such as:\n- Evidence of family living in the home country (family registers, residence documents). - Proof of owned property or long‑term tenancy. - Letters from employers noting future job opportunities after graduation. - Business registration certificates or partnership documents. - Previous international travel history showing they respected visa rules in other countries. These documents are not always requested, but they can help in borderline cases."

For screening, verify that the passport is not expired, not damaged, and matches the identity\ndetails on DS‑160 and SEVIS. 2.3 Form I‑20 (for F‑1/M‑1) or DS‑2019 (for J‑1)\nForm I‑20 is issued by a Student and Exchange Visitor Program–approved school for F‑1 or\nM‑1 students. It contains:\n- Student’s name, date of birth, SEVIS ID number. - School information and school code. - Program start and end dates. - Program level and field of study. - Tuition fees and estimated living expenses. - Details of any scholarships or school financial support. Key screening checks for I‑20:\n- SEVIS ID on the I‑20 matches the DS‑160 and the SEVIS payment receipt. - Program start date is in the future, and the visa is requested within the allowed time\nwindow (you can generally apply up to 365 days before the program start, but you may\nenter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before that date). - The program is full‑time and at an appropriate educational level. - The financial information on the I‑20 (costs and funding sources) is consistent with the\nfinancial documents submitted. For J‑1 programs, DS‑2019 plays a similar role, listing program sponsor, category, and\nfunding information. 2.4 SEVIS I‑901 fee payment receipt\nBefore a visa interview, most F‑1, M‑1 and J‑1 applicants must pay the SEVIS I‑901 fee and\nprint the payment confirmation receipt. This fee supports the Student and Exchange Visitor\nInformation System used to track students and exchange visitors in the U.S. Screening points:\n- SEVIS ID on the receipt must match the SEVIS ID on Form I‑20/DS‑2019. - The payment date should be before the interview. - If a student changes school and receives a new I‑20 with a new SEVIS ID, a new SEVIS fee\nmay be required unless the rules allow a transfer of the previous fee. ------------------------------------------------------------\n3. INTERVIEW APPOINTMENT, PHOTO AND MRV FEE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n3.1 Visa application (MRV) fee payment\nMost applicants pay a Machine‑Readable Visa (MRV) fee before scheduling the interview. Procedures vary by country but usually involve creating an online profile, paying the fee,\nand then selecting an appointment slot. Screening system tasks:\n- Record the MRV payment confirmation number and date. - Check that the barcode number on the appointment confirmation matches the DS‑160 and\nprofile. 3.2 Digital photo\nU.S. visa photos must follow strict rules for size, background, face position, and recency."

Schengen Area — Short-stay (visa) eligibility reference (tourist / business / short study / transit) — common rules across Schengen states\n\nOVERVIEW\nSchengen short-stay visa (Type C) rules are harmonized: common documentation includes valid passport, travel itinerary, sufficient funds, travel medical insurance, purpose evidence, and proof of intended return. Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes). SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

          "text": "Discover AXA Schengen Annual\n\nWhat is a Schengen work visa and how do I get one? I’m planning to work in Europe, do I need a Schengen work visa? There’s no such thing as a ’Schengen work visa’. You can only work in Schengen nations for long periods if you have a National D-type Work visa, which is issued by the country you are planning to work in - and will not entitle you to work in another state. However, if you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work reasons and your trip will last fewer than 90 days, then you can apply for a short-stay Schengen work visa allowing you to fulfill your business obligations. You will need to provide evidence that work is the purpose of your trip to be issued with a short-stay visa equivalent to the length of your posting in your desired Schengen Area. You must leave your host country before the expiry date shown on your visa. If your obligations exceed 90 days, you need a long-stay work visa type D. You may also need to validate it within three months following your arrival. What different types of Schengen visas exist ? How do I get a European work permit? To get a European work visa you need to check the employment visas offered in the country where you wish to work and figure out if you qualify. Meet the criteria, collect the required documents for an employment visa and schedule a visa interview. What documents do I need to obtain a short-stay Schengen work visa? If you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work purposes, for example, to represent your company or to meet with investors, suppliers, or potential clients or customers, you need a letter of invitation, specifying your business relationship and what you will be doing during the time you are in the country. It is a good idea for you to attach an itinerary of the business activities to the invitation letter so you can show your work plans. If you are an employee, you should also include documentation from your employer confirming that you are an employee and details of your work. These should include your job position, dates of employment, salary, and why you must travel for business purposes. It may also be a good idea to get a no objection letter from your employer in your home country. If self-employed, you will need to provide a copy of your business license, a company bank statement for the last six months, and an income tax return. From the end of 2023, citizens of countries with a visa-free arrangement for short stays in the Schengen Area will need to apply via the ETIAS system for short business trips. If you plan to work aboard for longer, you will need to apply for a national work visa. Is a work visa difficult to obtain?"

          "text": "U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING – DOCUMENT CHECKLIST AND GUIDANCE\n(2025)\nSource basis: This guide is based mainly on official U.S. government information about F‑1\nand M‑1 student visas from the U.S. Department of State (travel.state.gov), the Student and\nExchange Visitor Program (SEVP/SEVIS), and additional guidance from U.S. universities and\nconsular resources. It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening”\npurposes and is not legal advice. Always check the latest information from official U.S.\ngovernment websites and your local U.S. Embassy or Consulate before applying. ------------------------------------------------------------\n1. OVERVIEW OF U.S. STUDENT VISA SCREENING\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen someone applies for a U.S. student visa, consular officers and immigration systems\ncarry out several layers of checks. For most full‑time international students, this is the F‑1\nvisa (academic study) or M‑1 visa (vocational or technical training). J‑1 visas are used for\nexchange programs and have similar, but slightly different, rules. Visa “screening” means verifying that the applicant:\n- Has been admitted to an approved school and issued the correct SEVIS document. - Intends to study a genuine, full‑time course and meets the academic and English‑language\nrequirements. - Can pay tuition fees and living expenses without working illegally. - Plans to follow U.S. immigration rules and leave or change status legally when the\nprogram ends. - Does not present security, public‑safety, or public‑health risks. - Has provided complete and truthful information on all forms. The screening process uses documents uploaded by the student, information in the DS‑160\nonline visa application, SEVIS records, biometrics, security databases, and the in‑person visa\ninterview. A visa‑screening system must therefore pay special attention to both documents\nand consistency across all data fields. This document focuses on F‑1 visas applied for outside the United States, but most elements\nalso apply to M‑1 and to J‑1 student/exchange visas with minor changes. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE DOCUMENTS FOR A U.S. STUDENT VISA\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Form DS‑160 – Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application\nEvery nonimmigrant visa applicant must complete Form DS‑160 online and submit it\nelectronically. The form collects personal data, travel plans, education history, work history,\nfamily information, previous travel to the U.S., security questions, and social‑media\nidentifiers. Key screening points:\n- DS‑160 Confirmation Page: After submission, the system creates a confirmation page with\na barcode. The applicant must print or save this page and bring it to the interview. - Accuracy and consistency: Details (name, date of birth, passport number, school name,\nSEVIS ID, address, etc.) must exactly match the passport, Form I‑20, SEVIS record, and any\nuniversity letters. - Security and background questions: Answers to questions about crime, immigration\nviolations, terrorism, health issues, and previous visa refusals must be truthful. Mismatches\nbetween DS‑160 answers and security databases can lead to refusal or permanent\nineligibility. - Social‑media handles: Recent rules require applicants to list social‑media usernames used\nin the last several years. Officers may review online content as part of security vetting."

German citizens are therefore generally entitled to apply for an E visa. The applicant for the E-1 visa must be either the direct or indirect owner of the company, an executive employee or an employee with company-specific specialized knowledge, e.g. concerning the products being traded. What is necessary for the application and the processing time? The application process for the E-1 treaty trader visa includes several forms to be completed and an application package to be assembled. The documents must be sent by post and by e-mail to the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt/Main for the review of these documents. An important document is the business plan (or tax documents in the case of already existing and operating enterprises) with a profit and loss account forecast for the next five years. In particular, the business plan should show that the trade already exists, how it is to develop and that the majority of it takes place or will take place between the USA and Germany; precise percentage information is required here. Of course, information on the applicant, the (potential) customers and, if applicable, a German parent company must also be provided. You should expect a processing time at the U.S. consulate of eight to twelve weeks. After reviewing the application, the U.S. Consulate will contact you and you can make an appointment for you and your (willing to travel) family members (children under 14 usually do not need to appear in person) to come to the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt/Main. Can I bring my family with me to the U.S. on an E-1 visa? The principal applicant qualifying for an E-1 visa can also bring his or her spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 with him or her to the U.S. without having to meet any special conditions. However, they are also required to fill out various forms. The children are allowed to attend school or to study; the spouse is allowed to take a job in the USA. Whether the latter needs a work permit in addition to their visa, however, is disputed between the USCIS and the Social Security Administration. To be on the safe side, a relevant application should be submitted before starting work. However, this can only be done after entering the USA and not already in connection with the visa. The relevant application form is the I-765. E-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA\nE-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA - Visa Application Services\nIf you want to live in the USA for a longer period of time, a U.S. E visa is a good option. The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years."

          "text": "Yes! AXA will refund your insurance fees if your visa application is rejected in most cases. We’ll only ask that you provide official documentation explaining why your visa was refused (from the relevant embassy, consulate, or visa application center). Will it cost more to obtain a longer-stay Schengen Visa? Generally speaking, there is little difference — as the fee covers the costs of processing your application. However, longer-stay visa applications to work or study are dealt with at a national level — so the requirements may vary, and your destination country may ask you to pay fees covering additional documentation. Can I work or study in the Schengen Zone on a tourist visa? No. While the tourist (or Type C) allows visitors to enter the Schengen for a short business trip, a holiday, and/or to visit family members, it cannot be converted into a work or study permit. AXA can tell you more. What should I do if my visa is refused? You can either apply again or appeal. The EU’s Article 32(3) of the Visa Code of the Schengen Agreement can tell you more — but the outcome of your appeal will ultimately depend on the individual Schengen country’s authorities. How to apply for a Schengen business visa to Europe? Travel Insurance is mandatory to obtain a Schengen visa\n\nWritten by: Kurt Hambadda\nPublished on: 07/18/2025\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (aka IATA), roughly 600 million business trips are taken globally each year. And a good chunk of these, of course, happens to be to, from, and throughout the most visited continent on the planet – aka Europe. If you too are planning to be among the thousands of people saying “business” at a European airport on any given day, you might be wondering about the right type of visa for your trip. And that’s why AXA has all you need to know about the Schengen business visa below. What is a Schengen Business Visa? Who needs a Schengen Business visa? What are the main requirements for a Business Schengen Visa application? Where and when should I apply for a Business Schengen Visa? Tips to complete the application process for a Business Schengen Visa\nWhy choose AXA Travel Insurance for my Business Schengen Visa? Schengen Business Visa FAQ\nWhat Is a Schengen Business Visa? As its name suggests, a Schengen Business Visa is essentially a type of short-stay (aka Type C) Schengen visa ​–​this one designed specifically for non EU/EEA nationals traveling to the Schengen Area for business-related activities. Think meetings, conferences, contract negotiations, industry events, and so on (IMPORTANT: However, don’t think full-time employment–but more on that in our FAQs section below). Being granted a Schengen Business Visa (or a Business Schengen visa, if you prefer as they’re interchangeable) allows you to enter not just one but any of Europe’s dozens of Schengen countries. And, once there, it also offers you the freedom to cross any of their borders, and without needing any other separate visas."

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes).

Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6.

Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

It is written in simplified language for learning and “visa screening”\npurposes and is not a legal document. Always cross‑check with the latest guidance on\nGOV.UK before applying. ------------------------------------------------------------\n1. INTRODUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you apply for a UK Student visa, the decision maker (UK Visas and Immigration –\nUKVI) checks that you:\n- are a genuine student with an unconditional offer;\n- will study an approved course at a licensed sponsor;\n- can support yourself financially and pay your tuition fees;\n- meet health and character requirements; and\n- have provided all mandatory supporting documents. This checking process is often called visa “screening”. If any required evidence is missing or\ndoes not meet the format rules, UKVI can refuse the application even if you are otherwise\neligible. This document is designed as a training resource for building a UK visa‑screening\nsystem: it expands the official document list into a detailed, structured checklist that a\nsystem can use to verify whether the applicant has collected the correct evidence. The guide focuses on the standard Student visa route (for courses longer than 6 months)\nmade from outside the UK. Many of the requirements are also relevant to applications made\nwithin the UK, but some details differ. ------------------------------------------------------------\n2. CORE MANDATORY DOCUMENTS\n------------------------------------------------------------\n2.1 Current passport or travel document\nEvery applicant must provide a valid passport or other travel document. Key screening points:\n- The document must be valid on the date you submit the application and when you travel\nto the UK. - It should contain at least one blank page (front and back) so the visa vignette can be\nplaced in it if an eVisa is not used. - The personal details page must be clearly readable and not damaged. - If the passport will expire very soon after arrival, applicants are strongly advised to renew\nit before applying, because replacing a passport from abroad can be difficult. Evidence format:\n- Original physical passport (for in‑person biometrics) or electronic copy if applying using\nthe UK Immigration ID Check app. - If you hold more than one nationality, you may need to declare and provide details of all\npassports. 2.2 Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)\nThe second mandatory document is a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) issued\nby a licensed Student sponsor (usually your university or college). The CAS is an electronic\nrecord, not a paper letter, but universities often provide a CAS statement for your reference. Key screening points:\n- CAS reference number: you must enter this correctly in the online application form. - The CAS must be issued by a sponsor with a valid Student sponsor licence."

Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate. Provide course confirmation, tuition payment proof, accommodation. * For degree programs or courses **>90 days** → apply for national long-stay (D) student visa at the specific country consulate. ---\n\n## 6. Work & Long-Stay (National D Visas & Residence Permits)\n\n* **Employment authorizations are country-specific. ** Each Schengen state has its own work permit and national visa rules (e.g., Blue Card, skilled worker permit, seasonal worker permit). * Typical pattern:\n\n * Employer obtains work permit or labor clearance (varies by state). * Applicant applies for **national D visa** for entry/initial stay. * After arrival, applicant applies for a residence permit with local authorities. * **Salary & labor market tests** are decided by the issuing member state; your bot must consult the country-specific document for numeric thresholds or occupation lists. ---\n\n## 7. Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment. The policy must be valid for all Schengen countries and duration of stay. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}\n\nProof of funds & purpose\n- Applicants must provide evidence of accommodation, means of support for the visit (bank statements, sponsor letters), travel itinerary, and possibly invitation letters for business or family visits. Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes). SCHENGEN AREA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Schengen_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis file summarizes clear, unambiguous rules for short-stay Schengen (Type C) visas and related practical checks that a visa officer or a well-informed visa agent would use. It covers: who needs a visa, mandatory documents, medical insurance requirement, means of subsistence (proof of funds), biometric and entry rules (90/180), and common refusal reasons. Where rules differ by member state we note that the Member State’s consulate/embassy decides exact documentary thresholds.

It **avoids** volatile numeric details (national fees, exact minimum bank balances) except where a single pan-Schengen rule exists (e.g., insurance minimum). Use country-specific documents (one per Schengen state) for precise, changing numbers. ---\n\n## 1. Overview — What “Schengen” means\n\n* The **Schengen Area** is a group of European countries that have abolished systematic internal border controls for travelers moving between them. * A **Schengen short-stay visa (Type C)** permits stays in the Schengen Area for **up to 90 days in any 180-day period** for tourism, business, family visits, short studies, or transit. * **National (D) visas** are issued by individual member states for longer stays (work, study, family reunification, long-term residence). Rules for D visas are decided by each member state. ---\n\n## 2. Key Universal Rules (Apply across Schengen)\n\n### 2.1 The 90/180 Rule (Short-stay limit)\n\n* A non-EU/EEA national may stay in the Schengen Area for **a maximum of 90 days within any rolling 180-day period**. * This is cumulative across all Schengen states (not per country). The 180-day window is rolling (count backwards from each day of intended stay). ### 2.2 Visa Types (Short summary)\n\n* **Type C (Schengen short-stay):** tourism, business, family visit, short studies up to 90/180. * **Type D (National):** long-stay (>90 days) for study, work, family reunification, residence. Issued by individual member states; may allow limited travel within Schengen for short periods. * **Airport Transit Visa (Type A):** transit through international transit zones at airports (rare; many nationals exempt). ### 2.3 Biometric & Application Basics\n\n* Applicants normally **must provide biometric data** (fingerprints + photo) at the visa application center (VFS/consulate), once per 59 months (approx.) unless exempt. * Schengen visas require a **personal application** (rare exceptions for children or specific categories). ### 2.4 Travel Medical Insurance (Mandatory for short-stay)\n\n* For Schengen Type C visas, travel medical insurance is **mandatory** and must cover **medical emergency and repatriation**. * **Minimum cover**: **€30,000** (this is the commonly required minimum across Schengen consulates). Insurance must be valid for the entire period of intended stay and across the whole Schengen area. ### 2.5 Purpose & Supporting Documents (Short-stay)\n\nTypical required documents (vary by consulate / nationality):\n\n* Valid passport (valid for at least 3 months beyond intended departure from Schengen; with at least two blank pages). * Completed and signed visa application form. * Recent passport-style photos. * Proof of purpose: invitation letter, hotel bookings, conference confirmation, enrolment for short course. * Proof of financial means to cover stay. * Proof of travel medical insurance. * Return/onward travel tickets or reservation. * Proof of accommodation. * Visa fee (varies). * For minors: birth certificate, parental consent, custody proof."

How long is the L-1 visa valid? To open a new office, the L visa is valid for one year or residence in the USA is permitted for one year, after which it must be renewed. A stay of up to three years can be granted for renewals or for L visas applicable for collaboration with companies that are already in business. Renewals are possible for a two-year period. An L visa can be renewed a limited number of times. The holder of an L-1A visa (manager, executive) can thus work in the USA for a maximum of seven years; the holder of an L-1B visa (employee with specialized skills) can work for no more than five years. In this, it is not the possession of the visa for the specified period that counts but rather the physical stay in the USA. There may be exceptions for commuters who split their working time between the U.S. company and a group company outside the USA, i.e."

It may well be that a visa is issued for five years but the petition is only valid for three years; in which case, the holder is only allowed to work in the USA for three years and would need to have the petition extended before the expiry date, but without having to apply for a new visa. What requirements must companies fulfil? 1. Relationship between the two companies involved\n\nThe first requirement is that the existing company in the home country and the company established in the USA or the office to be opened have a qualifying relationship with each other. Such a qualifying relationship exists, for example, when a dependent branch is established in the USA. However, it can also exist if both companies are legally independent. The decisive factor is then, above all, that one company has a stake in the other and that one company exercises de facto control over the other. However, a majority shareholding is not mandatory. Finally, a qualifying relationship for an L-1 visa also exists if both companies are owned and controlled by a third company or a natural person, for example, belonging to one and the same sole proprietor. The L-1 visa is therefore usually considered for parent, subsidiary or sister companies. 2. Ongoing business activities in Germany\n\nThe home company must maintain its business operations while the employee is in the USA. An L-1 visa is therefore not suitable for individual entrepreneurs whose business at home stands idle while they set up a new business in the USA. 3. Opening of a new office\n\nIn connection with the secondment of an employee to open a new office, it must be proven - namely, at the time of application - that sufficient office space has been rented. The visa is initially issued for only one year. What are the requirements for the L-1 visa applicant? The requirement for an L-1 visa is that the person to be transferred to the USA has either held a managerial position in the German company or has acquired and applied company-specific specialized knowledge. The position in the USA must also be a managerial position or require the application of specialized knowledge acquired abroad. However, the position in the USA and in Germany do not have to be the same. That is, someone with a managerial function in Germany could also be employed with specialized knowledge in the USA and vice versa. 1. Managerial position\n\nA person operates in a managerial position if he or she is responsible for the management of the company or one of its departments and supervises other employees in a senior position and has at least a say in the hiring and dismissal of other employees. 2."

Contents on this page:\n\nWhat type of commercial activity is required for an E-1 visa? What requirements do companies need to fulfil? What are the requirements for applicants for an E-1 treaty trader visa? What is necessary for the application and the processing time? Can I bring my family with me to the U.S. on an E-1 visa? Our worldwide advice on the E-1 treaty trader visa\nWhat type of commercial activity is required for an E-1 visa? An E-1 visa is only issued to self-employed persons or employees of U.S. companies who trade between the treaty country (e.g. Germany) and the USA. The term \"trade\" is to be understood relatively broadly in this context. It includes not only the exchange of goods but also the provision of services in the transport sector as well as in the banking and insurance industries and in the tourism industry. It is important to note that the exchange takes place directly between the USA and the contracting country. The trade must be of a certain size or substantial. The turnover amount plays a role that should not be underestimated here; however, the regularity and frequency of the exchange of goods or services over a longer period of time are more important. It is indispensable that the trade already exists. Anyone looking to first set up a business in the USA in order to then engage in trade must apply for the E-2 investor visa; the E-1 visa is not initially available in this case. What requirements do companies need to fulfil? In order to work on an E-1 treaty trader visa for a company located in the USA, that company must be at least 50 percent owned by natural persons of the other treaty country. Thus, an indispensable requirement is that the U.S. target company is at least 50 percent owned by German citizens if Germans are applying for the E-1 visa. If, for example, U.S. citizens also intend to operate within the company, a minimum of 50 percent German participation must be particularly heeded when founding the company. Caution is also advised when Germans who already hold a permanent residence permit for the USA (Green Card) are involved or intend to be involved. In the present context, they are not considered German citizens. Particularly in the case of larger companies, it is also important to note: If, in the course of time, the shareholder structure changes in such a way that the requirements related to nationality are no longer met, previously issued E visas will become invalid, even if the validity date printed on them is still current."

          "text": "Specialized knowledge\n\nSpecialized knowledge that also qualifies for an L-1 visa may, for example, relate to the product range or services offered by the company. However, an L-1 visa may also be considered for jobs that require intimate knowledge of internal company procedures. This is, nevertheless, vital in such cases in which the skills required for the position are not available on the U.S. labor market. 3. Duration of the activity and full-time employment\n\nLast but not least, it is required that the employee to be sent to the USA has been employed by the German company in a managerial position or with specialized knowledge for at least one year within three years prior to the application process. It should also be noted that only full-time employment can be considered and that part-time employment, even over several years, is not sufficient under any conditions. All requirements must be fulfilled when submitting the petition\nIt should be borne in mind that all the factual requirements that must be met for the petition to be approved must be in place at the time the petition is submitted. If documents, evidence or information are missing, the USCIS will usually request them (request for evidence), but no opportunities will be granted to first create the additional necessary conditions. For example, if the U.S. company is based in one U.S. state but the petitioner intends to do business in a different U.S. state, both the state permits must have been granted and an office must already have been leased when the petition is filed. If the applicant forgot to submit the tenancy agreement, this can usually be submitted at a later date. If, however, the applicant forgot to conclude such a contract, it is not helpful to quickly achieve this and send it after the petition has been received. An entirely new petition must be submitted. Blanket Petition - When the petition for an L-1 visa is not applicable\nThe application process for an L-1 visa is rather complex. The U.S. employer must file a petition with a wide variety of documentation with the U.S. immigration authorities (USCIS) in advance. Only after the petition has been approved can the employee then apply for the actual visa at the U.S. consulate. However, companies that meet some special requirements have the opportunity to apply for a so-called blanket petition. This makes it possible for the employees to be posted to actually only be required to attend the appointment at the U.S. consulate. Thus, it is no longer necessary to submit a petition in advance. Generally, only a U.S. company that has been in business for at least one year and meets one of the following requirements is eligible for a so-called blanket petition:\n\nAt least ten L-1 visas have been successfully applied for via the U.S. company (or U.S. group) in the past twelve months (namely, for managers, executives or so-called specialized knowledge professionals, whereby only members of certain occupational groups fall into the latter category, i.e."

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6. Applicant must maintain financial funds (unless employer certifies maintenance). **Eligibility Notes:**\n\n* Applicant’s **income at home does not affect eligibility**. * Age does not matter. * Salary offered by UK employer must meet **threshold**, not applicant’s current salary. ---\n\n## **UK Student Visa Eligibility**\n\n1. **CAS letter** from a licensed education provider. 2. Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Common types of academic evidence:\n- Certificates of qualification (for example, 12th grade mark sheet, bachelor’s degree\ncertificate);\n- Official transcripts of results, stamped or sealed by the institution;\n- Printouts of results from an awarding body’s secure online verification system. Screening checks:\n- Do the qualification names and grades match the details in the CAS? - Are documents genuine‑looking (correct logos, spelling, signatures, seals)? - If any document is not in English or Welsh, is a certified translation attached? ------------------------------------------------------------\n9. TRANSLATIONS AND DOCUMENT FORMAT\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAny supporting document that is not in English or Welsh must be accompanied by a fully\ncertified translation. The translation must:\n- Be done by a professional translator or translation company;\n- Include confirmation that it is an accurate translation of the original document;\n- Include the date of translation;\n- Include the translator’s or translation company’s full name and contact details; and\n- Bear the translator’s signature.

          "text": "What is a Schengen visa? A Schengen visa is an entry permit for non-EU nationals to make a short, temporary visit of up to 90 days in any 180-day period to a country in the Schengen area. Schengen visas come in 3 forms: \n\nsingle-entry visa - allowing you to enter the Schengen area once;\nmultiple-entry visa - allowing several visits to the Schengen area for as long as the visa is valid;\nairport transit visa - allows you to connect through the international transit area of an airport in the Schengen area during a stopover or a change of flights. It does not allow you to leave the international transit area. How long can you stay? The short-stay calculator can help you calculate the remaining period you are allowed to stay in a Schengen country. Who needs to apply for a Schengen visa? Citizens of certain non-EU countries must hold a short-stay visa when travelling to the Schengen area. Consult the EU list of countries whose citizens are required to hold a visa when crossing its external borders. There are exceptions to the visa requirements for certain types of traveller to certain countries (e.g. diplomats, armed forces, refugees, pupils on school excursions). Airport transit visas\n\nSome non-EU nationals must also hold an airport transit visa when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in any of the Schengen States. For citizens of certain additional countries, an airport transit visa is required when connecting through the international transit areas of airports located in some of the Schengen countries. There are some categories of people who are exempt from the requirement to hold an airport transit visa (see Article 3(5) of the Visa Code). Where to apply\nYou must lodge your application for a Schengen visa at the consulate of the country you intend to visit. Visiting more than 1 Schengen countries: apply at the consulate of the country where you will spend the longest time. Visiting several Schengen countries (for stays of equal length): apply at the consulate of the first country you will visit. As a general rule, you must apply for a Schengen visa at the consulate with territorial responsibility for the country where you are legally resident. When to apply\nYou must submit your application to the consulate at least 15 days before your intended journey and no earlier than 6 months beforehand. You may have to book an appointment before lodging the application. What documents are needed to apply? A valid passport. The passport’s expiry date should be at least 3 months after the date of your departure from the Schengen area. For multiple-entry visas, the expiry date should be at least 3 months after your departure from the last country visited. A visa application form. A photo in compliance with ICAO standards. Medical insurance covering emergency medical care, hospitalisation and repatriation (including in the event of death)."

If I want to work in France as a seasonal worker, which visa should I apply for? To work as a seasonal in France, you need a work visa. You will be able to work in France six months out of 12. You must apply for a long-stay visa with the mention “travailleur saisonnier” (seasonal worker). If you have several French employers, you will need a work authorization. Then you will have to get a residence permit at the prefecture, within two months of your arrival in France. This is a pluriannual residence permit. However, your employer will have to grant you a new work authorization each year you work for them. Which other documents do I need to get a work visa for France? The following documents are required for a work visa application:\n\nYour visa application form, dated and signed, and the France-Visas receipt\nTwo recently taken passport photographs\nYour passport, delivered less than 10 years ago and with a minimum of two free pages. It has to be valid for at least three months after you leave the Schengen Area. In the case of a long-stay trip, it can be valid for three months after your visa expires. If your country of residency is different from your citizenship, you have to submit legal proof of residency in this country (residence permit…)\nProof of your visa insurance. Regarding your professional activity in France, you will have to provide:\n\nA work authorization which your employer will get via DIRECCTE (form Cerfa n°15187*02), sent directly to the embassy or the consulate of your country of residence by Office Français de l’Immigration et de l’Intégration (OFII)\nA copy of your degrees, qualifications and work certificate\nWhat is a work authorization? A work authorization is a document allowing a foreign citizen to work as an employee in France. To get a work visa, the company willing to hire a foreign citizen has to get a work authorization from DIRECCTE (Direction Régionale des Entreprises, de la Concurrence, de la Consommation, du Travail et de l’Emploi) to allow them to work legally in France. This authorization has to be included in the visa application. However, your employer does not have to get an authorization if your mission is linked to sport, cultural, artistic or scientific purposes, business tourism (summit or convention), movie and audiovisual production and broadcasting, musical production, visiting professorship or lectureship, or services to the employer during their stay in France (excluding companies). You have to justify the exemption by proving your mission in France is linked to your mission in your country of origin. If you are a model, you are also exempt and the agency has to fill in a specific form."

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position.

          "text": "However, because work is prohibited, a B-1 Visa traveler should never receive any salary or compensation from a U.S. company or individual for activities performed in the U.S. Reimbursement for travel expenses, on the other hand, are generally permissible. It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation. Each applicant must apply for his or her own B-1 Visa and must meet the visa requirements independently. Accompanying family members\nFamily members of a B-1 Visa holder can apply for a B-2 Visa as tourists. Our B-1 visa services\nIf you need assistance with the application for a visa feel free to contact us by e-mail (info@visum-usa.com) or by phone (+49 69 76 75 77 85 26). During the consultation we can discuss which visa(s) you may be eligible for and provide you with an overview of the application requirements. We can also assist you with the entire application process. We can customize our services to meet your needs. For example, if you have already decided that a B-1 Visa is the right one for you, we can forego the initial consultation and begin the process of assisting you with the B-1 Visa application right away. Contact us for more information. E-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA\nE-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA - Visa Application Services\nIf you want to live in the USA for a longer period of time, a U.S. E visa is a good option. The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

          "text": "However, this maximum period of stay may not apply if an I-140 petition for a green card is pending. New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nIn a recent update in September 2025, President Donald Trump amended the H-1B visa fee structure, raising the cost of applying for an H-1B visa to USD 100,000. This fee increase, as outlined by the White House, is part of an ongoing effort to fund border security and reduce visa fraud. These changes will have a significant impact on employers and foreign workers, especially those in industries that rely on specialized talent from abroad. The most notable change is the substantial hike in the base filing fee for H-1B applications. Employers will now face a USD 100,000 fee to sponsor foreign workers; a sharp increase compared to previous years (USD 1,000). A portion of this fee will go toward funding fraud detection and border security efforts. Non-profit organizations and educational institutions may still be eligible for reduced fees, but for-profit businesses will be subject to the full USD 100,000 fee, which could influence their decision to sponsor H-1B workers. As these changes affect both employers and workers, it’s important to understand how the new fees impact your situation. WINHELLER can help you understand these updates and provide the guidance you need to manage the process effectively. Can I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Unlike many other visas, including the H-2B visa, the H-1B visa does not require the applicant to prove that he or she has no immigration intentions or that he or she will maintain a foreign residence. Accordingly, without this being a disadvantage to him or her as a matter of law, the applicant may file a green card petition while working in the U.S. on a H-1B visa. Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may apply for an H-4 visa to accompany the applicant. Albeit, they are not allowed to then work. There is, however, one important exception to this rule: If an I-140 petition has been approved for the H-1B visa holder, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for work authorization. H-2B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa\nThe H-2B visa category is intended for non-agricultural employees seeking to work in the U.S. temporarily. H-2B visa for German nationals\nSince December 18, 2012, only nationals of certain countries are eligible to apply for an H-2B visa. For a long time, German nationals were not eligible, unlike nationals from many other EU countries, including Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Spain. However, as of January 30, 2018, Germans nationals are eligible for an H-2B visa. Other nationals currently eligible for an H-2B visa are listed below."

          "text": "Discover AXA Schengen Annual\n\nWhat is a Schengen work visa and how do I get one? I’m planning to work in Europe, do I need a Schengen work visa? There’s no such thing as a ’Schengen work visa’. You can only work in Schengen nations for long periods if you have a National D-type Work visa, which is issued by the country you are planning to work in - and will not entitle you to work in another state. However, if you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work reasons and your trip will last fewer than 90 days, then you can apply for a short-stay Schengen work visa allowing you to fulfill your business obligations. You will need to provide evidence that work is the purpose of your trip to be issued with a short-stay visa equivalent to the length of your posting in your desired Schengen Area. You must leave your host country before the expiry date shown on your visa. If your obligations exceed 90 days, you need a long-stay work visa type D. You may also need to validate it within three months following your arrival. What different types of Schengen visas exist ? How do I get a European work permit? To get a European work visa you need to check the employment visas offered in the country where you wish to work and figure out if you qualify. Meet the criteria, collect the required documents for an employment visa and schedule a visa interview. What documents do I need to obtain a short-stay Schengen work visa? If you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work purposes, for example, to represent your company or to meet with investors, suppliers, or potential clients or customers, you need a letter of invitation, specifying your business relationship and what you will be doing during the time you are in the country. It is a good idea for you to attach an itinerary of the business activities to the invitation letter so you can show your work plans. If you are an employee, you should also include documentation from your employer confirming that you are an employee and details of your work. These should include your job position, dates of employment, salary, and why you must travel for business purposes. It may also be a good idea to get a no objection letter from your employer in your home country. If self-employed, you will need to provide a copy of your business license, a company bank statement for the last six months, and an income tax return. From the end of 2023, citizens of countries with a visa-free arrangement for short stays in the Schengen Area will need to apply via the ETIAS system for short business trips. If you plan to work aboard for longer, you will need to apply for a national work visa. Is a work visa difficult to obtain?"

          "text": "Citizens of the USA, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, India or other non-EU countries must apply for a work visa to work in Europe. Each Schengen member state has its own immigration policies towards citizens of non-member states, tailored to their own needs. This means the ease with which you can obtain a visa will depend on the specific immigration policies of the country you are planning to work in. Your chances of acceptance will also depend on your profession and whether you meet the labor needs of the country concerned. Your future employer may also need to obtain a work permit from the national authorities. Before applying for a work visa you should check that you have a strong chance of matching the visa criteria of the country where you are planning to work.

Sometimes the process can be extended to 12 weeks, so it’s good to apply early. How long will my work visa be valid for? Most Schengen Area work visas entitle you to work for one year, but most countries allow you to apply for an extension upon their expiration. To do this, you will have to provide the authorities in the country you are working in with required documents, explaining the reason for extending your stay.

Schengen work visa cost varies depending on the country:\n\nFrance work visa costs €99\nThe cost of German work permit employment visa is €75\nThe cost of Spain work visa is $190 for USA citizens, $114 for Canada nationals and $67 for other nationalities\nThese may be subject to change over time and may be revised due to inflation and other costs or policy changes.

          "text": "Discover AXA Schengen Annual\n\nWhat is a Schengen work visa and how do I get one? I’m planning to work in Europe, do I need a Schengen work visa? There’s no such thing as a ’Schengen work visa’. You can only work in Schengen nations for long periods if you have a National D-type Work visa, which is issued by the country you are planning to work in - and will not entitle you to work in another state. However, if you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work reasons and your trip will last fewer than 90 days, then you can apply for a short-stay Schengen work visa allowing you to fulfill your business obligations. You will need to provide evidence that work is the purpose of your trip to be issued with a short-stay visa equivalent to the length of your posting in your desired Schengen Area. You must leave your host country before the expiry date shown on your visa. If your obligations exceed 90 days, you need a long-stay work visa type D. You may also need to validate it within three months following your arrival. What different types of Schengen visas exist ? How do I get a European work permit? To get a European work visa you need to check the employment visas offered in the country where you wish to work and figure out if you qualify. Meet the criteria, collect the required documents for an employment visa and schedule a visa interview. What documents do I need to obtain a short-stay Schengen work visa? If you need to travel to the Schengen Area for work purposes, for example, to represent your company or to meet with investors, suppliers, or potential clients or customers, you need a letter of invitation, specifying your business relationship and what you will be doing during the time you are in the country. It is a good idea for you to attach an itinerary of the business activities to the invitation letter so you can show your work plans. If you are an employee, you should also include documentation from your employer confirming that you are an employee and details of your work. These should include your job position, dates of employment, salary, and why you must travel for business purposes. It may also be a good idea to get a no objection letter from your employer in your home country. If self-employed, you will need to provide a copy of your business license, a company bank statement for the last six months, and an income tax return. From the end of 2023, citizens of countries with a visa-free arrangement for short stays in the Schengen Area will need to apply via the ETIAS system for short business trips. If you plan to work aboard for longer, you will need to apply for a national work visa. Is a work visa difficult to obtain?"

CONCLUSION AND BEST PRACTICES\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe UK Student visa process is rule‑based and document‑heavy. Many refusals arise from\nmissing, inconsistent or incorrectly formatted documents rather than from ineligibility. A\nrobust visa‑screening system should therefore:\n- Mirror the official GOV.UK structure: “Check if this visa is right for you”, “Prepare the\nevidence you need”, “Apply”, and so on. - Provide dynamic checklists based on the applicant’s circumstances (age, nationality,\nwhere they apply from, dependants, previous sponsorship). - Guide applicants step by step to upload each required document in the correct format. - Highlight high‑risk areas, such as financial evidence and TB certificates, where refusals are\ncommon. - Store structured metadata (for example, document type, issue date, issuing authority,\ncurrency, balance) so that automated validation rules can be applied. For real visa applications, applicants must always rely on the most recent Home Office\nguidance and, where necessary, professional immigration advice. However, this document\ngives a comprehensive, structured view of the evidence typically needed for UK Student visa\nscreening and can be used both as a learning aid and as source material inside a\nRetrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system for query answering."

          "text": "Before the employer can file its petition for the applicant with the immigration authorities, they must file what is known as a Labor Condition Attestation (LCA) with the U.S. Department of Labor. This must include information on salary and the absence of strikes. It must also be certified that either the relevant union with respect to the petitioner has been notified of the H-1B petition or, if there is no union, that the employer has posted a notice to that effect for at least ten days in their establishment. However, if the business relies more on workers with H-1B status, this can complicate the process. What is the application process? In 2020, the application process was significantly reconfigured, and electronic registration was introduced (H-1B electronic registration process). The first step is that the U.S. company seeking to employ foreign nationals must register with the USCIS in March. The registration period usually begins one week after that, during which the U.S. company (petitioner) can then submit data on potential foreign employees (beneficiaries). This is permitted for a period of about two weeks. If, in the end, the number of applications received is greater than the visas that can be granted, a lottery will be held, and the \"winners\" will then be informed that, from April 1 onwards, petitions can be submitted. Depending on how many petitions are received, another registration period may be held starting in early August. The petitions, which can be filed as of April 1, are somewhat more extensive than the information that must be submitted for registration; they include, among other things, the I-129 application form and documentation on the potential employee, such as, for example, evidence of his or her education and, if applicable, the equivalency of his or her foreign degree. Those who do not accelerate the processing by paying the premium processing fee (2,500 US dollars) will not receive feedback on the petition after approx. 15 days but may have to wait several months. Once the petition has been approved, the final step is to apply for the actual visa at a U.S. consulate in Germany. The H-1B visa is therefore subject to certain deadlines and cannot be applied for at any time, as is the case with many other work visas (e.g. categories E, L, O, J). What is the H-1B quota system? The issuance of H-1B visas is subject to quotas. Only 65,000 H-1B visas are granted per fiscal year (which begins in October of each year), and another 20,000 may be granted to applicants who have earned a Master's or higher degree from a U.S. university. Because of various special regulations, including nationality-specific regulations, well over 85,000 H-1B visas are eventually issued. What is the validity period of the H-1B visa? In most cases, the H-1B visa is initially issued for three years and is renewable thereafter. The maximum stay may not exceed six years."

Use this only as guidance — final decisions rest with USCIS / consular officers. H-1B (Specialty Occupation) — Core criteria\n- A “specialty occupation” requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge AND normally requires at least a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) in a specific field as the minimum entry requirement. Employers petition via Form I-129 and must generally attest to wage and labor conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\n- Key evidentiary elements: detailed job description showing specialized duties; educational credentials (U.S. degree or equivalent foreign degree) or equivalency documentation; employer’s Labor Condition Application (LCA); and an employment offer."

          "text": "However, this maximum period of stay may not apply if an I-140 petition for a green card is pending. New H-1B fees amended to USD 100,000: What you need to know\nIn a recent update in September 2025, President Donald Trump amended the H-1B visa fee structure, raising the cost of applying for an H-1B visa to USD 100,000. This fee increase, as outlined by the White House, is part of an ongoing effort to fund border security and reduce visa fraud. These changes will have a significant impact on employers and foreign workers, especially those in industries that rely on specialized talent from abroad. The most notable change is the substantial hike in the base filing fee for H-1B applications. Employers will now face a USD 100,000 fee to sponsor foreign workers; a sharp increase compared to previous years (USD 1,000). A portion of this fee will go toward funding fraud detection and border security efforts. Non-profit organizations and educational institutions may still be eligible for reduced fees, but for-profit businesses will be subject to the full USD 100,000 fee, which could influence their decision to sponsor H-1B workers. As these changes affect both employers and workers, it’s important to understand how the new fees impact your situation. WINHELLER can help you understand these updates and provide the guidance you need to manage the process effectively. Can I apply for a green card with an H-1B visa? Unlike many other visas, including the H-2B visa, the H-1B visa does not require the applicant to prove that he or she has no immigration intentions or that he or she will maintain a foreign residence. Accordingly, without this being a disadvantage to him or her as a matter of law, the applicant may file a green card petition while working in the U.S. on a H-1B visa. Can family members come to the USA with the applicant? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may apply for an H-4 visa to accompany the applicant. Albeit, they are not allowed to then work. There is, however, one important exception to this rule: If an I-140 petition has been approved for the H-1B visa holder, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for work authorization. H-2B Visa - U.S. Employment Visa\nThe H-2B visa category is intended for non-agricultural employees seeking to work in the U.S. temporarily. H-2B visa for German nationals\nSince December 18, 2012, only nationals of certain countries are eligible to apply for an H-2B visa. For a long time, German nationals were not eligible, unlike nationals from many other EU countries, including Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Spain. However, as of January 30, 2018, Germans nationals are eligible for an H-2B visa. Other nationals currently eligible for an H-2B visa are listed below."

In particular, no university degree is required. However, the applicant must produce sufficient evidence that he has any relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the offered position. If the H-2B visa will be used to perform unskilled labor, evidence of special skills and knowledge are not required. Requirements for the workplace\nThe offered position must be temporary in nature. Work that qualifying as temporary may include\n\na project-based activity or a one-time occurrence,\nseasonal employment,\nemployment resulting from holiday-related peaks in the tourism sector, or\nintermittent employment which requires occasional work without the prospect of permanent employment. Employer must file a temporary labor certification\nBefore the employee may apply for a U.S. visa at the consulate, the employer must have filed a Temporary Labor Certification (the “Certification”) with the U.S. Department of Labor and a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The Certification can be filed no earlier than 120 days before the expected start date of the employment. Furthermore, the employer must provide public notice regarding the job opening to potential U.S. employees. And the employer may be legally obligated to interview – and under certain circumstances hire – local candidates who are qualified for the position. Only after the employer has shown that there are no suitable U.S. candidates for the position will the U.S. Department of Labor granted the employer permission to move forward with the process of hiring the foreign applicant. Many employers will include in the job description a foreign language skills requirement to reduce the likelihood that a suitable U.S. employee will be found. However, the U.S. Department of Labor carefully considers foreign language skills requirements and often requires detailed evidence that such requirements are demonstrably indispensable for the position. Validity and extension of the H-2B visa\nIn most cases, the H-2B visa is initially issued for a maximum period of 1 year and can be extended, but not for longer than a total period of 3 years."

Why Salary Matters for H-1B\n\nFor H-1B visas, the employer must pay at least the **“actual wage”** or the **“prevailing wage”**, whichever is higher. * Actual wage: what current employees in similar positions earn at the same employer. * Prevailing wage: set by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) based on job location, SOC code, experience level (Level 1–4). Because prevailing wages vary significantly by geography, industry, and job level, there is **no fixed universal wage threshold**. Instead we can reason using **salary bands**. ---\n\n## 2. Salary Band Guidelines (for Software / Engineering / Common Tech Jobs)\n\nThese bands are approximate, meant to help eligibility reasoning. They are not legal thresholds. | **Band** | **Approx Annual Salary (USD, before tax)** | **Likely Corresponding Settings** |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Low Band** | ≈ 70,000 – 90,000 | Entry-level Software Engineer/Developer in low-to-mid cost regions; Level-1–2 wage levels. |\n| **Mid Band** | ≈ 90,000 – 120,000 | Junior-to-mid-level roles in mid-cost metro areas; Level-2 or low Level-3. |\n| **Upper-Mid Band** | ≈ 120,000 – 150,000 | Mid-to-senior roles in moderately expensive cities; Level-3 wage level. |\n| **High Band** | ≈ 150,000 – 200,000 | Senior / specialized roles, in high-cost metro areas (e.g., coastal tech hubs), Level-3/4. |\n| **Top Band** | > 200,000 | Senior/lead/architect/manager roles in high-cost metro regions or high-demand specialties; Level-4. |\n\n> **Important caveats:**\n>\n> * These bands are **guidelines**, not legal minima. > * Final wage eligibility depends on **job location, SOC code, required level, employer pay scales, benefits**. > * For low-band wages, acceptance depends on **low cost-of-living area** and verifying employer’s “actual wage.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. When Low or Mid-Band Might Be Accepted\n\nH-1B may still be approved at **low or mid-band** wages if:\n\n* Job location is in a **low or mid-cost area** (lower prevailing wage). * Role is **entry-level or junior** (Level 1 or 2). * Employer’s “actual wage” to similar staff is in that range (not just minimum). * The job duties match entry-level complexity (not senior/architect-level). * Employer provides proper documentation (LCA, wage attestation). In such cases, $75,000–85,000 in a small or mid-cost city could be valid; but in high-cost cities $100,000 might be borderline. ---\n\n## 4. When Wage Must Be Upper-Mid or Higher\n\nWage should be in **Upper-Mid / High / Top Band** if:\n\n* Job location is a **high-cost metro** (e.g., San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles)."

Express Entry does not change or replace the requirements of these\nimmigration programs. 3\nExpress Entry: Changes how Canada selects skilled immigrants\nMoving from the old system… to Express Entry\n- First applicant in, first to be processed - CIC selects candidates that are most likely to\nsucceed in Canada, rather than the first in line\n- Difficult to navigate the immigration\nsystem due to multiple players - Express Entry candidates with a valid job offer or\nP/T nomination will quickly be invited to apply (ITA)\n- Recruitment of global talent at employer\nfor permanent residence\ntime and expense\n- Later in 2015 (exact date TBC), the new Job Bank\n- Average of 12-14 months to process an\nwill connect Canadian employers with a pool of\napplication\nskilled foreign national candidates if they can’t find\nCanadians or permanent residents to do the job\n- Express Entry candidates will benefit from\nprocessing times of six months or less*. *In 80% of cases from receipt of complete application for\n4\npermanent residence to final decision. The New Two-Step Application Process: Candidate\n5\nStep 1: Express Entry Profile\n- Candidates can promote themselves:\n- They are encouraged to signal their presence in the\nExpress Entry pool to recruiters, on private sector job\nboards, participate in job fairs, contact Canadian\nemployers directly, etc. - Registration with Job Bank is required unless a\ncandidate has a valid job offer or PT nomination\n6\nExpress Entry Pool\n- All candidates in the Express Entry pool are assigned a score according\nto their skills, education and experience\n- Candidates profiles can remain in the pool for up to 1 year\n– At the one year mark, candidates will be asked if they would like to\nresubmit their profile\n– Candidates can update their profiles at any time if their\ncircumstances change, which may change their score\n- Candidates in the pool are ranked against others in the pool according\nto their score\n- CIC will issue Invitations to Apply to those candidates ranked highest at\na given time from the pool (frequency and volumes to be determined)\n7\nWhat is the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) and\nwhy is it necessary?"

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6. Applicant must maintain financial funds (unless employer certifies maintenance). **Eligibility Notes:**\n\n* Applicant’s **income at home does not affect eligibility**. * Age does not matter. * Salary offered by UK employer must meet **threshold**, not applicant’s current salary. ---\n\n## **UK Student Visa Eligibility**\n\n1. **CAS letter** from a licensed education provider. 2. Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

There are two types of family-based immigrant visas:\n\nImmediate Relative – these visas are based on a close family relationship with a U.S. citizen, such as a spouse, child or parent. The number of immigrants in these categories is not limited each fiscal year.

Canada — Visa & permit eligibility reference (Work permits, Study permits, Visitor)\n\nOVERVIEW\nSummarizes core Canadian program rules: employer-driven work permits (LMIA where required), study permits (DLIs, proof of funds), visitor rules. Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options. It is written to be unambiguous and suitable for a retrieval-augmented pipeline (RAG). All factual claims that are likely to change (amounts, named programs) are cited to the official Government of Canada pages.

          "text": "- Use of documents from unregulated banks or unverifiable financial institutions. - Over‑reliance on funds that are not easily accessible (for example, property valuations\nwithout a loan or sale). - Financial stories that conflict with the student’s stated background or DS‑160 answers. ------------------------------------------------------------\n5. ACADEMIC, ENGLISH AND STUDY‑PLAN EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n5.1 Admission letter and academic documents\nAlthough the primary official record of admission is the I‑20 or DS‑2019, students usually\nbring:\n- University admission or offer letter. - Academic transcripts and diplomas (school, college, previous university). - Standardized test scores (such as TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT) if required by\nthe school. These documents help show that the student is academically prepared. Screening checks:\n- The course details in the admission letter are consistent with the I‑20 (program name,\nlevel, start date). - Academic history in DS‑160 matches the transcripts and qualifications supplied. - Any gaps in education or work history are explained. 5.2 English‑language ability\nFor most academic programs, U.S. schools set minimum English‑language requirements. The consular officer may also informally evaluate English during the interview. Poor\nlanguage ability may raise doubts about whether the student can follow the course and\nwhether the offer of admission is genuine. A screening engine can:\n- Record test names, scores, and test dates. - Compare scores with program requirements. - Flag missing or expired English‑language evidence for schools that normally require it. 5.3 Study plans and career goals\nDuring the interview, officers often ask why the applicant chose that particular course,\nuniversity and country, and how the education fits into their long‑term plans. There is no\nseparate document for this, but consistency between the personal statement provided to\nthe university, DS‑160 answers, and interview responses is crucial. From a visa‑screening perspective, large mismatches (for example, weak academic history\nbut very expensive, unrelated course with vague career plan) may signal higher refusal risk. ------------------------------------------------------------\n6. NONIMMIGRANT INTENT AND TIES TO HOME COUNTRY (INA 214(b))\n------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder section 214(b) of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, most nonimmigrant visa\napplicants are presumed to be intending immigrants unless they can convince the officer\nthat they will respect the terms of their visa and leave the U.S. or change status lawfully at\nthe end of their permitted stay. For students, this means demonstrating both:\n- A credible plan to study full‑time and follow status rules; and\n- Strong connections (“ties”) outside the U.S. that make it likely they will leave after study,\nsuch as family responsibilities, career prospects, property, or business. 6.1 Typical “ties” evidence\nApplicants may bring informal supporting documents such as:\n- Evidence of family living in the home country (family registers, residence documents). - Proof of owned property or long‑term tenancy. - Letters from employers noting future job opportunities after graduation. - Business registration certificates or partnership documents. - Previous international travel history showing they respected visa rules in other countries. These documents are not always requested, but they can help in borderline cases."

United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND ATAS EVIDENCE\n------------------------------------------------------------\n4.1 Proving knowledge of English\nFor most Student visa applications, you must show that you can speak, read, write and\nunderstand English to a certain level. Evidence may include:\n- An academic qualification taught in English and accepted by UKVI as meeting the\nrequirement; or\n- An approved English language test (for example IELTS for UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI or\nsimilar) at the level appropriate for your course; or\n- Being a national of a majority English‑speaking country listed by the Home Office; or\n- Having completed a degree‑level qualification in the UK previously. Screening checks:\n- Does the course require English evidence based on its level and whether it is below degree\nlevel? - If a test certificate is used:\n– Is the test provider on the list of approved Secure English Language Test (SELT)\nproviders? – Is the test still valid on the date of application? – Are the scores at or above the minimum for the CAS/course level? 4.2 Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)\nFor certain postgraduate courses in sensitive subjects (mainly science, engineering and\ntechnology fields), students of specific nationalities must obtain an ATAS certificate before\napplying for a visa. Key points:\n- The CAS will normally state whether ATAS is required and include the relevant subject\ncode. - The ATAS certificate is issued as a digital letter. It must be valid (usually 6 months) when\nthe visa application is submitted. - If ATAS is required and not provided, the visa will be refused."

In this, it is not the possession of the visa for the specified period that counts but rather the physical stay in the USA.

It may well be that a visa is issued for five years but the petition is only valid for three years; in which case, the holder is only allowed to work in the USA for three years and would need to have the petition extended before the expiry date, but without having to apply for a new visa. What requirements must companies fulfil? 1. Relationship between the two companies involved\n\nThe first requirement is that the existing company in the home country and the company established in the USA or the office to be opened have a qualifying relationship with each other. Such a qualifying relationship exists, for example, when a dependent branch is established in the USA. However, it can also exist if both companies are legally independent. The decisive factor is then, above all, that one company has a stake in the other and that one company exercises de facto control over the other. However, a majority shareholding is not mandatory. Finally, a qualifying relationship for an L-1 visa also exists if both companies are owned and controlled by a third company or a natural person, for example, belonging to one and the same sole proprietor. The L-1 visa is therefore usually considered for parent, subsidiary or sister companies. 2. Ongoing business activities in Germany\n\nThe home company must maintain its business operations while the employee is in the USA. An L-1 visa is therefore not suitable for individual entrepreneurs whose business at home stands idle while they set up a new business in the USA. 3. Opening of a new office\n\nIn connection with the secondment of an employee to open a new office, it must be proven - namely, at the time of application - that sufficient office space has been rented. The visa is initially issued for only one year. What are the requirements for the L-1 visa applicant? The requirement for an L-1 visa is that the person to be transferred to the USA has either held a managerial position in the German company or has acquired and applied company-specific specialized knowledge. The position in the USA must also be a managerial position or require the application of specialized knowledge acquired abroad. However, the position in the USA and in Germany do not have to be the same. That is, someone with a managerial function in Germany could also be employed with specialized knowledge in the USA and vice versa. 1. Managerial position\n\nA person operates in a managerial position if he or she is responsible for the management of the company or one of its departments and supervises other employees in a senior position and has at least a say in the hiring and dismissal of other employees. 2."

Contents on this page:\n\nWhat type of commercial activity is required for an E-1 visa? What requirements do companies need to fulfil? What are the requirements for applicants for an E-1 treaty trader visa? What is necessary for the application and the processing time? Can I bring my family with me to the U.S. on an E-1 visa? Our worldwide advice on the E-1 treaty trader visa\nWhat type of commercial activity is required for an E-1 visa? An E-1 visa is only issued to self-employed persons or employees of U.S. companies who trade between the treaty country (e.g. Germany) and the USA. The term \"trade\" is to be understood relatively broadly in this context. It includes not only the exchange of goods but also the provision of services in the transport sector as well as in the banking and insurance industries and in the tourism industry. It is important to note that the exchange takes place directly between the USA and the contracting country. The trade must be of a certain size or substantial. The turnover amount plays a role that should not be underestimated here; however, the regularity and frequency of the exchange of goods or services over a longer period of time are more important. It is indispensable that the trade already exists. Anyone looking to first set up a business in the USA in order to then engage in trade must apply for the E-2 investor visa; the E-1 visa is not initially available in this case. What requirements do companies need to fulfil? In order to work on an E-1 treaty trader visa for a company located in the USA, that company must be at least 50 percent owned by natural persons of the other treaty country. Thus, an indispensable requirement is that the U.S. target company is at least 50 percent owned by German citizens if Germans are applying for the E-1 visa. If, for example, U.S. citizens also intend to operate within the company, a minimum of 50 percent German participation must be particularly heeded when founding the company. Caution is also advised when Germans who already hold a permanent residence permit for the USA (Green Card) are involved or intend to be involved. In the present context, they are not considered German citizens. Particularly in the case of larger companies, it is also important to note: If, in the course of time, the shareholder structure changes in such a way that the requirements related to nationality are no longer met, previously issued E visas will become invalid, even if the validity date printed on them is still current."

          "text": "Specialized knowledge\n\nSpecialized knowledge that also qualifies for an L-1 visa may, for example, relate to the product range or services offered by the company. However, an L-1 visa may also be considered for jobs that require intimate knowledge of internal company procedures. This is, nevertheless, vital in such cases in which the skills required for the position are not available on the U.S. labor market. 3. Duration of the activity and full-time employment\n\nLast but not least, it is required that the employee to be sent to the USA has been employed by the German company in a managerial position or with specialized knowledge for at least one year within three years prior to the application process. It should also be noted that only full-time employment can be considered and that part-time employment, even over several years, is not sufficient under any conditions. All requirements must be fulfilled when submitting the petition\nIt should be borne in mind that all the factual requirements that must be met for the petition to be approved must be in place at the time the petition is submitted. If documents, evidence or information are missing, the USCIS will usually request them (request for evidence), but no opportunities will be granted to first create the additional necessary conditions. For example, if the U.S. company is based in one U.S. state but the petitioner intends to do business in a different U.S. state, both the state permits must have been granted and an office must already have been leased when the petition is filed. If the applicant forgot to submit the tenancy agreement, this can usually be submitted at a later date. If, however, the applicant forgot to conclude such a contract, it is not helpful to quickly achieve this and send it after the petition has been received. An entirely new petition must be submitted. Blanket Petition - When the petition for an L-1 visa is not applicable\nThe application process for an L-1 visa is rather complex. The U.S. employer must file a petition with a wide variety of documentation with the U.S. immigration authorities (USCIS) in advance. Only after the petition has been approved can the employee then apply for the actual visa at the U.S. consulate. However, companies that meet some special requirements have the opportunity to apply for a so-called blanket petition. This makes it possible for the employees to be posted to actually only be required to attend the appointment at the U.S. consulate. Thus, it is no longer necessary to submit a petition in advance. Generally, only a U.S. company that has been in business for at least one year and meets one of the following requirements is eligible for a so-called blanket petition:\n\nAt least ten L-1 visas have been successfully applied for via the U.S. company (or U.S. group) in the past twelve months (namely, for managers, executives or so-called specialized knowledge professionals, whereby only members of certain occupational groups fall into the latter category, i.e."

We will help you with questions regarding the O visa\n3 categories of the O visa\nU.S. visa: O Visa for Individuals Who Are Extraordinary\nThe O visa allows artists, entertainers, actors, athletes, scientists and the like to live and work in the USA for a limited period. The prerequisite for an O visa is that the applicant would like to work in the USA in the field related to their extraordinary abilities. It is not necessary to find a U.S. employer who is looking to hire the applicant on a permanent, long-term basis. If such an employer exists, they may file the petition. However, if a U.S. employer is not available, a U.S. agent must file the O-1 petition. The O visa includes three main sub-categories: the O-1A visa, the O-1B visa and the O-2 visa. The O-3 visa is for spouse and children of an O-1 or O-2 alien. O-1A visa\nAn O-1A visa is available to individuals who possess extraordinary ability in the field of sciences, arts, education, business or athletics; have received ongoing national or international recognition for their extraordinary ability; and intend to work in the U.S. temporarily in the same field. O-1B visa\nPersons who can demonstrate a record of extraordinary achievement in film or television production may qualify for an O-1B visa to work in the U.S. temporarily in the same field.

          "text": "Appointments are usually available within a few days or one to two weeks. As a rule, the Consulate does not review whether the specific requirements for the O visa have been met. Which visa must my accompanying personnel apply for? If an artist or athlete holds an O-1 visa, an O-2 visa may be issued for accompanying personnel if the accompanying person is indispensable to the O-1 visa holder's venture. Whether someone is indispensable depends on the visa holder's occupation, the O-2 applicant's skills and/or knowledge and cooperation prior to submitting the application. If the O-1 visa holder works in the fields of science, business, education/training, an O-2 visa cannot be issued. What type of visa applies to family members? Spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21 may accompany persons traveling to the United States on an O-1 or O-2 visa. However, they are not then allowed to work. They will receive a U.S. visa of the category O-3. How long is the O visa valid? The visa entitles the holder to enter the country ten days before the start of the activity or the date indicated on the application (more precisely: the approval notice) up to a U.S. stay ten days beyond the date indicated on the application. However, work is not allowed during these ten days. IMPORTANT: The visa does not determine how long the visa holder is allowed to work in the USA . The visa itself is often issued for a full five years. The visa is merely permission to travel to the U.S. and ask for entry. How long you are allowed to work is determined by the petition (i.e. approval notice) and the I-94 form. The petition must therefore be presented together with the visa at the time of entry. The (electronic) form will be issued by a border official upon entry. O visa or P visa - When do I apply for which visa? While the O visa is usually suitable for individuals (possibly together with accompanying support personnel) who would like to perform in the USA or work in a company, the P visa is more suitable for groups of artists or athletes (sports team, string quartet, etc.) who would like to perform in the USA. Additionally, for athletes who would like to compete in the USA and receive not only prize money but also other compensation from a U.S. source, the P visa is the more appropriate visa category."

It is sometimes difficult to determine with certainty whether an activity is or is not allowed when traveling on a B-1 Visa. For example, amateur athletes and amateur performers are generally permitted to perform and participate in events as long as they receive no payment for their performance or participation and only incidental expenses are reimbursed. Professional entertainers, on the other hand, are prohibited from using a B-1 visa to perform – even if they receive no payment for the performance. Other permissible B-1 activities include attending scientific and business conferences, attending court hearings and engaging in independent research. If certain requirements are met, the B-1 Visa may also be used to engage in limited work activities, such as the installation and maintenance of industrial equipment or machinery purchased outside the United States. However, anyone seeking to take advantage of these limited exceptions must very carefully follow the relevant rules or risk a denial of entry or status violation. Each applicant must apply for his or her own B-1 Visa and must meet the visa requirements independently. Accompanying family members\nFamily members of a B-1 Visa holder can apply for a B-2 Visa as tourists.

E-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA\nE-1 Visa - Treaty Trader Visa For The USA - Visa Application Services\nIf you want to live in the USA for a longer period of time, a U.S. E visa is a good option. The E-1 visa is available for both employees and self-employed persons. Unlike most other visa types, E visas can be extended indefinitely. However, the visas do need to be renewed every two to five years. While an L visa requires the holder to leave the USA again after seven years at the latest and bars them from entering the USA again with an L or H visa for one year, an E visa practically allows permanent residence - at least as long as the relevant requirements are met.

German citizens are therefore generally entitled to apply for an E visa. The applicant for the E-1 visa must be either the direct or indirect owner of the company, an executive employee or an employee with company-specific specialized knowledge, e.g. concerning the products being traded. What is necessary for the application and the processing time? The application process for the E-1 treaty trader visa includes several forms to be completed and an application package to be assembled. The documents must be sent by post and by e-mail to the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt/Main for the review of these documents. An important document is the business plan (or tax documents in the case of already existing and operating enterprises) with a profit and loss account forecast for the next five years. In particular, the business plan should show that the trade already exists, how it is to develop and that the majority of it takes place or will take place between the USA and Germany; precise percentage information is required here. Of course, information on the applicant, the (potential) customers and, if applicable, a German parent company must also be provided. You should expect a processing time at the U.S. consulate of eight to twelve weeks. After reviewing the application, the U.S. Consulate will contact you and you can make an appointment for you and your (willing to travel) family members (children under 14 usually do not need to appear in person) to come to the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt/Main. Can I bring my family with me to the U.S. on an E-1 visa? The principal applicant qualifying for an E-1 visa can also bring his or her spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 with him or her to the U.S. without having to meet any special conditions. However, they are also required to fill out various forms. The children are allowed to attend school or to study; the spouse is allowed to take a job in the USA. Whether the latter needs a work permit in addition to their visa, however, is disputed between the USCIS and the Social Security Administration. To be on the safe side, a relevant application should be submitted before starting work. However, this can only be done after entering the USA and not already in connection with the visa. The relevant application form is the I-765.

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6. Applicant must maintain financial funds (unless employer certifies maintenance). **Eligibility Notes:**\n\n* Applicant’s **income at home does not affect eligibility**. * Age does not matter. * Salary offered by UK employer must meet **threshold**, not applicant’s current salary. ---\n\n## **UK Student Visa Eligibility**\n\n1. **CAS letter** from a licensed education provider. 2. Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

          "text": "Yes! AXA will refund your insurance fees if your visa application is rejected in most cases. We’ll only ask that you provide official documentation explaining why your visa was refused (from the relevant embassy, consulate, or visa application center). Will it cost more to obtain a longer-stay Schengen Visa? Generally speaking, there is little difference — as the fee covers the costs of processing your application. However, longer-stay visa applications to work or study are dealt with at a national level — so the requirements may vary, and your destination country may ask you to pay fees covering additional documentation. Can I work or study in the Schengen Zone on a tourist visa? No. While the tourist (or Type C) allows visitors to enter the Schengen for a short business trip, a holiday, and/or to visit family members, it cannot be converted into a work or study permit. AXA can tell you more. What should I do if my visa is refused? You can either apply again or appeal. The EU’s Article 32(3) of the Visa Code of the Schengen Agreement can tell you more — but the outcome of your appeal will ultimately depend on the individual Schengen country’s authorities. How to apply for a Schengen business visa to Europe? Travel Insurance is mandatory to obtain a Schengen visa\n\nWritten by: Kurt Hambadda\nPublished on: 07/18/2025\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (aka IATA), roughly 600 million business trips are taken globally each year. And a good chunk of these, of course, happens to be to, from, and throughout the most visited continent on the planet – aka Europe. If you too are planning to be among the thousands of people saying “business” at a European airport on any given day, you might be wondering about the right type of visa for your trip. And that’s why AXA has all you need to know about the Schengen business visa below. What is a Schengen Business Visa? Who needs a Schengen Business visa? What are the main requirements for a Business Schengen Visa application? Where and when should I apply for a Business Schengen Visa? Tips to complete the application process for a Business Schengen Visa\nWhy choose AXA Travel Insurance for my Business Schengen Visa? Schengen Business Visa FAQ\nWhat Is a Schengen Business Visa? As its name suggests, a Schengen Business Visa is essentially a type of short-stay (aka Type C) Schengen visa ​–​this one designed specifically for non EU/EEA nationals traveling to the Schengen Area for business-related activities. Think meetings, conferences, contract negotiations, industry events, and so on (IMPORTANT: However, don’t think full-time employment–but more on that in our FAQs section below). Being granted a Schengen Business Visa (or a Business Schengen visa, if you prefer as they’re interchangeable) allows you to enter not just one but any of Europe’s dozens of Schengen countries. And, once there, it also offers you the freedom to cross any of their borders, and without needing any other separate visas."

What different types of Schengen visas exist ? What documents will I need to get a Schengen Student Visa?

Those studying in Italy must also obtain a residency permit. Getting a visa to study in Germany requires proof you have the funds: an average student needs to live on - €853 per month.

Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Canada — Visa & permit eligibility reference (Work permits, Study permits, Visitor)\n\nOVERVIEW\nSummarizes core Canadian program rules: employer-driven work permits (LMIA where required), study permits (DLIs, proof of funds), visitor rules. Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options.

How the Assistant Should Decide (Decision Logic, Non-Hallucinated)\n\n* **If user is visa-exempt for short stays → return “Visa not required” (but check ETIAS/entry rules). **\n* **If user lacks any mandatory document (insurance, funds, passport validity, return ticket) → “Not Eligible / Insufficient documentation.”**\n* **If itinerary exceeds 90 days in 180 days or overlaps previous Schengen stays → “Not Eligible: 90/180 exceeded.”**\n* **If user has missing ties or suspicious intent to overstay → mark as “High risk” and request more evidence. **\n* **For national long-stay/working permission → check country-specific criteria (salary, labor test, institution acceptance). **\n* **Always ask for country-specific details, then consult that country doc before stating numeric thresholds. **\n\n---\n\n## 14. Example Responses / Templates (Agent Style)\n\n* **Yes (clear):** “Based on your nationality X, purpose = tourism, planned stay 7 days, valid passport and travel insurance with €30,000 cover, and proof of funds/ticket, you are eligible to apply for a Schengen short-stay visa. This is subject to consulate review.”\n* **No (clear):** “Your planned stay totals 120 days in the Schengen Area within 180 days. Under the 90/180 rule you are not eligible for a Schengen short-stay visa for that itinerary.”\n* **Insufficient information:** “I need the passport nationality, intended dates/duration, travel medical insurance details (provider & €30,000 cover), and proof of accommodation to decide.”\n\n---\n\n## 15."

Job offer from a **Home Office licensed sponsor**. 2. **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** issued by employer. 3. Job must be on the **eligible occupations list**. 4. Minimum salary:\n\n * Standard: **£38,700 per year** (or going rate for the job). 5. English level: **B1**. 6. Applicant must maintain financial funds (unless employer certifies maintenance). **Eligibility Notes:**\n\n* Applicant’s **income at home does not affect eligibility**. * Age does not matter. * Salary offered by UK employer must meet **threshold**, not applicant’s current salary. ---\n\n## **UK Student Visa Eligibility**\n\n1. **CAS letter** from a licensed education provider. 2. Proof of **financial capacity**:\n\n * Tuition first year + 9 months living cost. 3. English requirement (varies by level). 4. Genuine student test during visa interview (sometimes). 5. Passport + biometrics. **Critical Case:**\n\n* If the student has **CAS but no financial proof**, visa will likely be refused. United Kingdom — Visa eligibility reference (Skilled Worker, Student, Visitor, key evidence)\n\nOVERVIEW\nThis note summarizes the principal public rules and the typical evidence required for UK Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored), Student, and Visitor visas. Always consult gov.uk for the final up-to-date rules. Skilled Worker (employer-sponsored) — core tests\n- You must have a confirmed job offer from a UK sponsor who holds a sponsor licence; the job must meet the required skill level and you must be paid the required salary — either the standard salary threshold (typically a published “standard” rate) or the “going rate” for that occupation, whichever is higher. Exact thresholds and going rates are published by the UK government. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}\n- Some jobs on the immigration salary list allow lower minimum salaries (80% rule, etc. ); check the official immigration salary list for your occupation code. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\n\nStudent visa — funds & CAS\n- You need a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) and to show enough money to cover course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months) and living costs (amounts differ for London vs. outside London). The CAS contains the course fee amount to be proved. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}\n\nVisitor / short stay\n- Show purpose of visit, funds, travel itinerary, and strong ties/home return evidence. Visa officers assess credibility and supporting documents. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY / JOB ROLE / INCOME\n- Health checks: some visa types (e.g., long-term settlement routes) require TB tests, and healthcare surcharge is charged for many visa types; specific medical tests depend on the route. - Age is not a universal disqualifier; eligibility focuses on the route and criteria (sponsor, salary, CAS, funds). - Family: dependents may be allowed for certain sponsored routes—check specific rules. UNITED KINGDOM — COMPLETE VISA ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: UK_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis document is a factual summary of UK visa eligibility rules for common non-immigrant and limited-stay migrant routes."

Canada — Visa & permit eligibility reference (Work permits, Study permits, Visitor)\n\nOVERVIEW\nSummarizes core Canadian program rules: employer-driven work permits (LMIA where required), study permits (DLIs, proof of funds), visitor rules. Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options. It is written to be unambiguous and suitable for a retrieval-augmented pipeline (RAG). All factual claims that are likely to change (amounts, named programs) are cited to the official Government of Canada pages.

Canada — Visa & permit eligibility reference (Work permits, Study permits, Visitor)\n\nOVERVIEW\nSummarizes core Canadian program rules: employer-driven work permits (LMIA where required), study permits (DLIs, proof of funds), visitor rules. Work permits (LMIA / employer-specific)\n- Many employer-specific work permits require a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) demonstrating a need for a foreign worker; other streams are LMIA-exempt and use offer/employer portals. Employer obligations and the LMIA process are detailed on Canada.ca. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}\n\nStudy permits — proof of funds\n- Applicants must be enrolled at a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) and show proof they have enough money to cover tuition, living expenses for themselves and accompanying family, and return transportation. Canada has a Student Direct Stream (SDS) with GIC requirements (e.g., specific GIC amounts like CAN$20,635 for certain periods) and revised guidance on living-cost thresholds. Exact amounts and accepted proof documents are posted by IRCC. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}\n\nVisitor / short stays\n- Evidence of funds, travel purpose, and intent to leave at end of authorized stay are central. For some temporary worker permits, employer support documents (contract, LMIA) are required. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY /INCOME\n- Health checks required when indicated (e.g., long stays, certain nationalities). No universal age limit — eligibility depends on program conditions. Proof of funds amounts (e.g., Express Entry minimum settlement funds) are published and vary by family size. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}\n\nCANADA — COMPLETE VISA & ELIGIBILITY REFERENCE\n(File: Canada_Eligibility_Full.txt)\n\nSCOPE\nThis document contains clear, authoritative eligibility rules for major Canadian temporary entry routes (study, work, visitor) and immediate-dependent work options. It is written to be unambiguous and suitable for a retrieval-augmented pipeline (RAG). All factual claims that are likely to change (amounts, named programs) are cited to the official Government of Canada pages.

Member states may request additional documents. Travel medical insurance\n- Mandatory: travel medical insurance valid for the entire Schengen area for the whole stay with a minimum coverage of **EUR 30,000** for emergency medical treatment, repatriation, and urgent hospital treatment.

Specific evidence and local additional rules vary by Schengen member state. Longer permits / work & study\n- Long-term national visas and residence permits (work, study) are handled by the individual member state; requirements (salary thresholds, work contracts, study acceptance letters, health insurance and subsistence) vary and are listed on each country’s immigration pages. HEALTH / AGE / FAMILY\n- Medical insurance and sufficient means are central. Age itself is not a universal disqualifier; certain permits may have minimum age limits (e.g., some youth mobility schemes).

Visitor / Tourist Visa (Type C) — Practical Rules\n\n* Purpose: tourism, visiting friends/family, business meetings, cultural/sports events, short study (<90 days). * **Proof of ties to home country** is important: employment letter, property, family, enrolment. * **Intent to return** is assessed; lack of return ties increases refusal risk. * **Travel insurance** and itinerary/reservations are required. * **Invitation letters** should include host details, relationship, duration and accommodation commitment. ---\n\n## 5. Short-Term Study & Training\n\n* For courses **<90 days**: short-stay (Type C) is appropriate.

Study Long-Stay (National Student Visas)\n\n* For degree studies (>90 days), applicants need an acceptance letter from an accredited institution, proof of funds to cover tuition and living costs (amount varies by state), proof of accommodation, and health insurance. * Work while studying: rules vary by country (commonly 10–20 hours/week during term; full-time during breaks) — consult national doc. ---\n\n## 8. Family Reunification & Dependent Visas\n\n* Family reunification rules differ by state but commonly cover:\n\n * Spouses/registered partners\n * Minor children\n * Dependent adult children or dependent parents (in some cases)\n* Sponsor’s obligations: proof of accommodation, income sufficiency, relation proof, sometimes integration orientation / language proof. * For long stays, family members typically apply for **national visas** and then residence permits. ---\n\n## 9. Health & Vaccination Rules\n\n* No general EU-wide vaccination requirements for entry; however some member states may request medical checks for long-term residence. * Travel insurance with medical evacuation is mandatory for short-stay visa. ---\n\n## 10."

How the Assistant Should Decide (Decision Logic, Non-Hallucinated)\n\n* **If user is visa-exempt for short stays → return “Visa not required” (but check ETIAS/entry rules). **\n* **If user lacks any mandatory document (insurance, funds, passport validity, return ticket) → “Not Eligible / Insufficient documentation.”**\n* **If itinerary exceeds 90 days in 180 days or overlaps previous Schengen stays → “Not Eligible: 90/180 exceeded.”**\n* **If user has missing ties or suspicious intent to overstay → mark as “High risk” and request more evidence. **\n* **For national long-stay/working permission → check country-specific criteria (salary, labor test, institution acceptance). **\n* **Always ask for country-specific details, then consult that country doc before stating numeric thresholds. **\n\n---\n\n## 14. Example Responses / Templates (Agent Style)\n\n* **Yes (clear):** “Based on your nationality X, purpose = tourism, planned stay 7 days, valid passport and travel insurance with €30,000 cover, and proof of funds/ticket, you are eligible to apply for a Schengen short-stay visa. This is subject to consulate review.”\n* **No (clear):** “Your planned stay totals 120 days in the Schengen Area within 180 days. Under the 90/180 rule you are not eligible for a Schengen short-stay visa for that itinerary.”\n* **Insufficient information:** “I need the passport nationality, intended dates/duration, travel medical insurance details (provider & €30,000 cover), and proof of accommodation to decide.”\n\n---\n\n## 15."
