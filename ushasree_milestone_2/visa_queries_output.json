        "query": "I am 28 years old, accepted to a US university, but I have no funding letters. Can I get an F1 visa?",
        "answer": "ELIGIBILITY: Partially\n\nREASONS:\n*   You have been accepted to a US university, which fulfills a primary requirement for an F1 visa, demonstrating a clear purpose of travel.\n*   F1 visas for the USA allow sponsorship by parents or relatives. However, proof of adequate financial means is mandatory for all student visas to cover tuition and living costs.\n*   Your statement of having \"no funding letters\" is a significant concern. Strong financials, whether self-funded or through sponsorship, are a key factor in visa decisions. Without documentation such as sponsor letters, employment letters from sponsors, and bank statements (yours or your sponsors'), it is not possible to establish that you meet the financial requirements.\n*   Submitting an application without this critical financial documentation would be considered \"poor documentation preparation,\" which is a risk factor evaluated by visa officers.\n\nFINAL DECISION:\nEligibility for an F1 visa cannot be confirmed without providing adequate and documented proof of funds to cover your educational and living expenses in the U.S. Further financial documentation is required."

        "query": "I am 41 and received a job offer from a UK company under the Skilled Worker visa. Is there an age concern?",
        "answer": "ELIGIBILITY: Yes\n\nREASONS:\n- The provided documents define the Skilled Worker route for EEA and non-EEA nationals sponsored for a specific skilled job.\n- The requirements for the Skilled Worker route are split into validity, suitability, and eligibility, none of which explicitly list an upper age limit for main applicants.\n- Age is only mentioned in the context of \"New entrants,\" where an applicant under 26 on the date of application may qualify as a new entrant for specific tradeable points options (E and J). This classification does not indicate that being over 26 disqualifies an applicant, but rather that being under 26 offers a specific advantage or classification.\n\nFINAL DECISION:\nBased on the documents provided, your age of 41 does not present a concern for eligibility for the UK Skilled Worker visa."

        "query": "I am 40, earning \u20b950 LPA, with a Canadian work offer. Will my age or income affect Work Permit eligibility?",
        "answer": "ELIGIBILITY: Partially\n\nREASONS:\n*   The provided documents do not specify any explicit age limits or disqualifying age criteria for a Canadian Work Permit. Age is mentioned as a factor contributing to the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score for **permanent residence** applications through Express Entry, but not directly for work permit eligibility.\n*   The documents do not state any minimum income requirements for a Canadian Work Permit, particularly regarding an applicant's current foreign income (\u20b950 LPA). The salary thresholds detailed in the documents relate specifically to the **UK Skilled Worker visa** and are not applicable to Canada.\n*   While a \"qualifying job offer\" is noted as a factor that can provide additional points in the CRS for permanent residence applications, the documents do not detail the specific eligibility requirements for a general Canadian Work Permit itself, nor how a Canadian job offer directly determines eligibility in terms of age or current income.\n\nFINAL DECISION: The provided information is insufficient to fully determine the impact of your age or current income on your Canadian Work Permit eligibility."

        "query": "I have a large unexplained gap in education. Will it affect my Student visa approval?",
        "answer": "ELIGIBILITY: Partially\n\nREASONS:\n- The provided documents primarily discuss requirements for Skilled Worker visas (specifically related to \"new entrants\" and course completion for that category), and Subclass 189 (Skilled Independent) visas, including skills assessments and English language criteria.\n- There is no information within the provided text directly addressing \"unexplained gaps in education\" as a factor for Student visa approval or refusal.\n- The documents do not outline the specific eligibility criteria or suitability requirements for a standalone Student visa application that would allow for an evaluation of an education gap.\n\nFINAL DECISION:\nBased on the provided documents, there is insufficient information to determine how an unexplained gap in education would affect your Student visa approval. The documents do not cover Student visa eligibility criteria in detail."

        "query": "I am 19 and want to travel solo to the US for tourism. Will I face extra scrutiny on a B1/B2 visa? [",
        "answer": "ELIGIBILITY: Yes\n\nREASONS:\n*   According to U.S. age-based rules for B1/B2 Tourist visas, solo travelers between the ages of 18 and 22 face \"Higher scrutiny.\" As you are 19, you fall within this age range.\n*   For B1/B2 visa applicants, it is crucial to demonstrate strong ties to your home country, especially given the increased scrutiny for solo young travelers.\n*   Visa officers evaluate risk factors such as \"weak ties to home country\" and \"unclear purpose of travel,\" which are often scrutinized more closely for applicants in your age group traveling solo for tourism.\n\nFINAL DECISION: Your application for a B1/B2 visa for solo tourism at age 19 will be subject to higher scrutiny, requiring robust evidence of strong home country ties and a clear purpose of travel."
